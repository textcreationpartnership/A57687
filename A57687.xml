         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> was willing to take this Opportunity of an Addreſs, that I might make my grateful Acknowledgments for the obliging Favours I have received from you. While you were in a private Capacity you were aſſiſtant to your Friends and Relatives, and have not forgot them, ſince you were in a public Concern, wherein you have been ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Kingdom, that if I have not been miſ-informed, you have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and honoured by ſeveral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:101430:4"/>and in a particular manner by our gracious King and Queen: And poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly few Perſons have ſerved the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſo long with ſo little Advantage to their own private Intereſt as you have done; which demonſtrates the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Spirit, and a generous Contempt of the World. I have had the Happineſs of an intimate Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you, and been oft with Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction entertain'd by you with Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſcourſes, That I can without a flattering Complement, ſay, I have thought you a great Maſter of Reaſon. And when you have been in an hurry of Affairs, and under the fatigue of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon others Account more than your own, you have appeared ſo calm and ſerene, that there hath no Wrinkle been ſeen in your Brow, nor Paſſion in your Breaſt, to ruffle and diſcompoſe you. You have not had the least Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mind, but have been as ſedate,
<pb facs="tcp:101430:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>and tranquill (like the pure <hi>Aether</hi>) as thoſe that have had no Concern of their own, or others upon them. And this laſt Character makes you as Great a Master of Empire, as the most victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conqueror, if we may believe one of the most excellent Poets.</p>

               <hi>He that is ſlow to Anger, is better than the Mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> But beſides the Obligation of Gratitude, I have another Reaſon why I preſume on this Dedication, becauſe you have a pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Judgment, and can well judge of a rational Conſequence from Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb facs="tcp:101430:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>or a true Deduction from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſeeing I have from theſe two Topicks undertaken a Defence of one of the main Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (whoſe Principles I have heard you heartily eſpouſe, and rationally maintain) I ſubmit it to your Cenſure, which tho' it may deſerve, yet I dread not; becauſe your natural Goodneſs will, I doubt not, mix ſo much Candour therewith, that it will inſtruct, rather than affright; and I had much rather have a Cenſure with a Reaſon, than an Approbation without it, becauſe the one may make a Man wiſe, when the other may be a Temptation to Pride. But I will not trouble you long, becauſe the Minutes of Public Perſons are not to be diſturbed. Nor ſhall I need, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not ſo well able (as others to whom I reſerv that Province) to give a true Character of your Worth: Nor am I willing if I were able, becauſe I
<pb facs="tcp:101430:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>have known you long endued with ſuch a ſtock of the Vertues of Humility and Modeſty, you had rather do well than hear of it; and are much better pleaſed in the Reflections of your Mind, than with the Eulogies of the best Men. And I am very confident you never did a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Public, or a Kindneſs for a Friend, but it was as great a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to your ſelf, as it was to them who received the Benefit, and reap'd the Advantage. Great Spirits that are endued with ſtrength of Reaſon, and have obtained a Conquest over unruly Paſſions, are Perſons fit for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of Public Employments: And that you have a large proportion of theſe Qualifications, is not only my Judgment, (which poſsibly may not be valuable) but the Obſervation of thoſe that have known how faithfully you have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a Trust for the Publick: And therefore by giving this Account, I
<pb facs="tcp:101430:6"/>cannot in the leaſt be ſuſpected guilty of Flattery. Men that are qualified for public Service may be ſaid in a true ſenſe to anſwer the Ends, promote the Conduct, and carry on the Deſigns of a wiſe Providence in his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and Government over, the World. And ſuch Perſons who by their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (with the Man after Gods own heart) ſerve their Generation,

            <p>I Beſeech you out of Love to your Souls, caſt not aſide this Tract after you light on a Matter that diſpleaſes, but ponder why you are diſpleaſed. If your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Religion are charged to be againſt Evidence of Reaſon, and Teſtimony of Holy Writ, you ought to be offended, becauſe you entertained ſuch high Thoughts of your Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; but if you will not aſſume or take ſo much Confidence, proceed, and conſider if the Author hath, or hath not good cauſe to
<pb n="II" facs="tcp:101430:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>oppoſe you; &amp; whatever the Reſult be on a due Trial, you will have no Cauſe to be troubled at your labour in the Inquiſition or Search: For if there be no cauſe to oppoſe your Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, you may think you have ground to continue them: If the Author hath ground for what he writes, you may with Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alter them. It is probable a word may be too jocoſe or too ſharp; but let not ſuch Expreſſions cauſe the Argument to be curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or haſtily read, but weighed without the lett of Paſſion, or byaſs of Intereſt to hinder that Conviction the Author aims at. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare with ſincerity I bear not any Bitterneſs towards any, nor was I under an emotion or heat of Mind, when I ſtudied or preached on this Subject. The Author knows how hard it is to remove a prejudice, and withal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it no eaſie thing to change Sentiments (how impertinent ſoever) born and bred with us. For ſuch Reaſons as theſe, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Indignation againſt my Adverſaries; but truly pity them, becauſe they ſubdue not that intemperate Zeal by which they appear for Novel Opinions againſt Primitive Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Eccleſiaſtic Eſtabliſhments. I have endeavoured to expreſs my ſelf as moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I could, not deſigning to provoke a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but work a Conviction. I have treated my Adverſaries with reſpect, deſigning only to reduce them from Error to Truth, not to boaſt of Victory, or proclaim a Triumph. If you have other thoughts of him, than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,

I will now acquaint you with the Reaſon engaged me in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. You may believe me (who know my own Mind beſt) it was a charitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on ſuch deluded Perſons, as have ſincere Intentions for what is true, (but through the ſmallneſs of their Underſtanding, have ſuch narrow Capacities as not to attain the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth,) and a Zeal to promote Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine. His Adverſaries may entertain what thoughts they think fit; his natural Temper is not waſpiſh nor contentious; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he diſpleaſed with any, becauſe he doth not think as he doth: He knows not of any Quarrel he hath with any on the Account of Religion: He neither affecteth Differences, nor is maintained thereby: He hath poſſibly more Eſteem than he deſerves; but if not, what he is ſatisfied with, as much as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him from being tempted to envy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the unworthy Arts of purchaſing Credit by leſſening his Neighbour. And as he publiſhes not this for popular Applauſe, ſo is he at no loſs for what he oppoſes; but it is the Intereſt of Religion, and a Love for Truth have engaged him in this buſineſs; for he apprehends them greatly endanger'd by Error. Many Perſons have not time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Cauſes of Matters of Moment,
<pb n="IV" facs="tcp:101430:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>nor are they without great Importunity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged therein: But believe as ſuch act, for whom they have an Admiration; and though they know not the Reaſon of things, they oft outvy thoſe they follow. That the Truth of Religion be diſcovered, tends much to the quiet of the World, and the welfare of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Men cannot but believe it neceſſary Religion ſhould be clearly underſtood; and certainly ſuch Men's Travels deſerv Praiſe, who endeavour to make perſons know its Principles, that their practice may be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. I can with ſincerity own I have uſed my Endeavours to ſet this Controverſie in as clear a Light as the Revelation of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Dictates of Reaſon could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, which are the beſt Inſtructors of our Mind in the knowledge of Truth, and the beſt Directors how to lead our Lives accordingly. But I may wiſh for Succeſs on this charitable Deſign, rather than expect it, if there be Truth in the excellent

            <head>An Account of the Conference with Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> upon the Subject of Infant-Baptiſm, and the Occaſion of it.</head>
            <p>AFter this, I hope uſeful Introduction, I come to perform the Obligation of my Promiſe, which was to give a Relation of a Conference publicly held with an <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt</hi> of no ſmall Fame on the Subject, and of the Occaſion; and this I will endeavour to do with all imaginable Sincerity, and take all poſſible Care not to commit any volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Error, or wilful Miſtake.</p>
            <p>In the Month of <hi>October</hi> 1686. I was collated to a Living by my reverend Dioceſan: After a Year I received Information that an <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt</hi> had perverted one of my Pariſh. But I hope without a reproachful Reflection I may ſay of ſome that pervert tru Doctrin, what the Holy Jeſus ſaid of the glozing <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.

Accordingly he did, and I readily went, where I treated him with all the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he could look for, and diſcourſed what I thought proper; and I ſpoke with all the kindneſs and plainneſs was poſſible, that what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

All I could get, was an importunate Requeſt I would permit him to bring one to diſpute with me: I was much againſt it at firſt; becauſe uſually ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns come to no good, nor ſeldom have their deſired end, but are attended with noiſe and clamour, and generally there is a greater Conteſtation for Victory than Truth, and a Man's Reputation is more conſulted than their Satisfaction on whoſe Account the Meeting is appointed.</p>
            <pb n="IX" facs="tcp:101430:11"/>
            <p>The Anſwer he gave, was, He was no Scholar, and ſo not able to diſcourſe with a Man of Learning, as he ſuppoſed me to be: I replied, whatever my Stock of Learning was, I would make no uſe of it with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I charitably intended his Good; but this inſtead of ſatisfying, engaged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Importunity, there might be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Diſputation, which he pretended would be much to his Satisfaction; but I believe it was but a pretence. For on the Account of ſome after-Circumſtances, I have reaſon to conjecture that his Importunity for ſuch a Meeting, was not ſo much to be convinced, as from a Confidence that the Advocate he pitch'd on (for he was in Vogue with his Party for his Diſputatious Faculty; and as I have heard, hath often travelled many Miles to diſpute with a Clergy man) would ſo far baffle me, it would give a Reputation to his Cauſe, and confirm him in his Principles: But becauſe he could not prevail for a Conſent, his Neighbour joined, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring I would comply: Upon which, out of reſpect to him I condeſcended; but on this Condition, there might be but a few at the hearing of our Diſcourſ; and if he would name how many he would bring, I would endeavour to equal his Number, or be content with fewer: For I told him, I believed three or four judicious Perſons of a ſide, might better underſtand the Reaſon and Truth of an Argument, than a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
<pb n="X" facs="tcp:101430:12"/>For I had for many Years been of the ſame Mind with the ingenious Mr. <hi>Matthew Clifford,</hi> who hated Crowd and Noiſe.</p>
            <p>A little after, I had notice my Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would bring his Man on <hi>December</hi> the thirteenth, 1687. And becauſe I would be juſt to my Word, I acquainted (to the beſt of my Knowledge) only two Perſons; <hi>viz.</hi> my Pariſhioner's Neighbour, and his Father: But he on the other ſide dealt unfairly with me; for, contrary to his Promiſe, he ſent his Man to Church (the Sunday before the Day) to acquaint my People, when Sermon was done, there was to be a Diſpute between Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> and My ſelf. Some time before which, I addreſſed my ſelf to a Conſideration of the Doctrine of Baptiſm, and the Holy Goſpel Covenant, and what Perſons are to be admitted thereto, and to enjoy the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges by receiving the Sign thereof. I had only by me one Book on the Subject, that treated of the Nature of the Covenant; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons that were not capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Articles thereof, could by the external ſign be admitted to the Privileges.</p>
            <p>But I had a belief he would not, or cared not to manage the Controverſy from that Principle; and thereupon I laid the Book aſide, and for ſome time conſulted the Holy Scriptures, and addreſſed my ſelf by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and ſincere Prayers to the Throne of Grace for the Divine Aſſiſtance, not in the leaſt truſting to my ſelf; but earneſtly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="XI" facs="tcp:101430:12"/>the Aid of Heaven, that the God of Truth would enable me to maintain what was true: And this I the rather did, becauſe I believed this one of the Doctrins of Faith once delivered to the Saints,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Jude verſ. 2.</note> St. <hi>Jude</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Chriſtians earneſtly to contend for. When the Day was come, I waited till about ten or eleven of the Clock before my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt appeared, about which hour he came, and knock'd at door; which when I opened, I ſaw him and a great Crowd, I let in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as my room I intended for our Diſpute would hold; for ſo many crowded in. There were ſome ſcores. After I let him in, he walked ſomewhat briskly, and with a ſort of Smile (as if I were to be led in Triumph, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Victors dealt with their conquered Slaves,) at the end of my Hall, attacks me with a Challenge to diſpute in the Church. I told him there ſeemed ſome Vanity in the Requeſt, as if he deſigned Noiſe more than Argument.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I deſired him to look into my Parlor, which I told him was large enough for as many as were fit to hear us: Beſide, I told him to diſpute in the Church might be accounted a Riot; and I asked him, if he would ſecure me from the damage I might ſuſtain, by undergoing the Penalty aſſigned for the Tranſgreſſion of the Laws? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he anſwered, he thought the Act for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience was my Security: To which I replyed, though I had the uſe of my
<pb n="XII" facs="tcp:101430:13"/>Church for Preaching, as he his Meeting-place to Hold-forth in; yet I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Law allowed the Church to be a place for Diſputation, nor was it fit it ſhould, becauſe it was improper, where the Holy Goſpel of Peace was Preached, there Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or Controverſie ſhould be managed. However, if he would go to my Reverend Dioceſan, and requeſt his leave, upon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from him I would comply. After which he walked into my Parlour to enter into Diſcourſe: I told him, being ſo many were gathered together, we ſhould act with good Intentions, deſigning the People's ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that they might be convinced which of us had Truth on his ſide, being our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were diametrically oppoſite, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary; not conſulting our Credit, as if we contended for Victory more than Truth; and being we of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had the Laws on our ſide for what we profeſſed, and as we thought Truth in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, he ought by ſtrong Reaſons to ſhew our Title was not Good, before he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſ-ſeize us of the Truth, we hoped we juſtly poſſeſſed: But before we begun, I deſired one thing, which I thought was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe for the Good of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and that was, I had a Licenſe from my Lord Biſhop to teach School, and on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I had an Uſher, that did write a fair and ſwift hand, and deſired he might write the Argumentative part of our Diſcourſe,
<pb n="XIII" facs="tcp:101430:13"/>and ſuch Collateral Proofs we urged to ſtrengthen our Arguments; and after our Conference was done, the Writing might be viewed by ſuch as heard us, and they have Liberty to judge which had ſpoken moſt Truth; and that he might be ſure he ſhould not be impoſed on, I told him, the Man that wrote what he ſpoke ſhould read it, and ask him if it were his Words and his Senſ, or if he could read Written-hand, he ſhould read it himſelf; which I had not ſaid, but he moved me, by asking an impertinent Queſtion before; but he anſwered, he would have nothing writ on either ſide. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal being denied, I had another to make, which was as reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> That I might propoſe two or three Caſes, that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the greateſt part of what was neceſſary for ſolving the Doubts, and anſwering the Objections againſt Infant-Baptiſm; and if he would allow any of his Party to underſtand the Principles of <hi>Antipaedobaptiſm</hi> better than himſelf, I would appeal to him, whether they did not; or if he thought I impoſed too much by ſuch a Propoſal, (for I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before his coming to treat him with civility,) I would allow him the Liberty I deſired to take; provided the Queſtions he ſhould ask were as proper as mine; for I am of the Poet's Mind,
<q>— Damus petimuſque viciſſim.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer I had, was, He ſhould not ask me a Queſtion, nor ſhould I ask him one;
<pb n="XIV" facs="tcp:101430:14"/>upon which I replyed, That his coming was to wrangle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot diſpute; and I was ſorry the People were ſo diſappointed; however, I was willing they ſhould hear what he had to ſay, on which I deſired him to begin; but I perceived (which he ought not to have done, for a Reaſon I have hinted) he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I ſhould begin; whereupon I did: But before I give an Account of what was ſaid, I will give you the three Caſes, propounded for a reſolution of.</p>

            <p>And now (being I was engaged to begin) I will give as true an Account as I can of what I offered, and he anſwered. I told him, I thought it as reaſonable Children ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Covenant under the Holy Goſpel, as under the Law, there being nothing more in the Holy Goſpel-Covenant to debar them an admiſſion thereto, than there was in that under the Law; beſides, it adds ſtrength to the Argument, if we conſider, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Holy Goſpel Covenant, are for ſubſtance one and the ſame, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us expreſsly,
<note place="margin">Gal. iii. 8.</note> and as we have made appear in the Book;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid. p.</hi> 97, 98. of this Book.</note> and certainly the Holy Apoſtle underſtood the Nature and Difference of Covenants, better I believe than any <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> To all which he made no return; but after ſome Pauſe, and an Harangue to the People, he told me he would not be ſatisfied unleſs I brought him an Example out of the Holy
<pb n="XVI" facs="tcp:101430:15"/>Scriptures of the New Teſtament, for any Child being Baptized; or a Command for his admiſſion into Covenant that way. To which I urged the probability of Children being Baptized,
<note place="margin">Acts xvi. 15.33.</note> when it is ſaid, <hi>That Lydia was Baptized, and her Houſhold;</hi> and of the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>That he was Baptized, and all his ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>

I am very ſorry I have forgot what he ſaid; but if I could remember it. I would do him that Juſtice, as to relate it; for I would pay my Adverſary that reſpect, as to declare all the Truth and Reaſon of him that his Cauſe will bear, or that he can with good ground de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; but that which is but probably true, may notwithſtanding be falſe. However, that I may allow my Adverſary all he can reaſonably ask, ſuppoſing there were no Children in thoſe Houſes mentioned,

               </note> for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Children, <hi>in ſo many Words;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I asked him, If he believed ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand neceſſary; to which he replyed, He did: I returned upon him, I thought it was undecent, if not abſurd, ſo poſitively to aſſert a thing neceſſary, and offer no Reaſon; beſide, I ſaid if he would give a Reaſon why he believed it neceſſary, I would do that which by Rules of Diſputation he could not oblige me to, (for no Man is bound to prove a Negative,) <hi>viz.</hi> prove it not neceſſary: Hereupon he made a longer Pauſe than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and after he recovered himſelf, made ſo long an Harange to thoſe preſent, I was forced to pull him by the Sleeve, and deſire him not to make my Houſe a Meeting-place, and aſſume, or take, ſo much Conſidence, as to inſtruct my People, unleſs he thought me not able for ſuch an Employment; which if he did, I deſired him to make proof, and when he had done, to make his complaint to my Reverend Dioceſan: Upon which, with a ſort of flattering ſmile, he complemented me, and told me he thought me able for my Office, and ſaid, he and I might agree well in all points but one, <hi>viz.</hi> Infant Baptiſm; for he heard I was an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and ſo was he: Whereupon I told him, I ſomewhat doubted whether he underſtood the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarticular Controverſie, managed at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and knew what an <hi>Arminian</hi> was; but whether he did or no, was not
<pb n="XVIII" facs="tcp:101430:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>material now; but I acquainted him I deſired not to paſs under any Character, but that of a Chriſtian; nay, that Honourable Name, (for the beſt things may be abuſed,) in ſome Caſes and Circumſtances (if I underſtand St. <hi>Paul</hi> right, where it is uſed for a Faction in oppoſition to Chriſtian Peace) is blame worthy: <hi>Now this I ſay, that every one of you ſaith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.12, 13.</note> and I of Chriſt; Is Chriſt divided, was Paul Crucified for you, or were you Baptized in the Name of Paul:</hi> So that there were four Parties in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did I affect to be called by a Name that ſhould preſerve Univerſal Charity, I would eſpouſe that of a Reformed Catholique (without renouncing the Name, <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>) And then I offered a Reaſon, why there was no neceſſity for an expreſs Text of Holy Scripture, in the New Teſtament, for the Baptizing Infants; becauſe it was ſo long known in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church before our Bleſſed Saviour's days; and as he took the other Sacrament from the <hi>Jews Poſt-coenium,</hi> or After-Supper; ſo he took this from their way of admitting Proſelytes of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before they Circumciſed them: And why ſhould we not for the ſame Reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar Women from the Lord's Supper, as Children from being admitted by Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Covenant, ſeeing there is no more Command for one, than for the other: So that Chriſt's not ſaying, whether Children
<pb n="XIX" facs="tcp:101430:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>were admitted to Baptiſm, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cogent Proof, that weighing the former <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms, it is the ſtrongeſt Motive to believe it. But ſtill (notwithſtanding all I ſaid to ſhew the abſurdity of his Requeſt, and the Arguments I offered to ſignifie the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch a Demand, without anſwering one of my Reaſons) my Adverſary importuned me for an expreſs place of Holy Scripture, in the New Teſtament, for the Baptizing Children; whereupon I asked him, if I brought a place of Holy Scripture, whoſe Sence could have no other tolerable meaning, but the allowance of Infants to be Baptized, it were not the ſame, as if I brought expreſs Words for Baptizing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? which he yielded: Upon which it pleaſed God (as if he would aſſiſt the defence of his Divine Truth; for I thought not on it before; this I own becauſe I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to aſcribe any thing to my ſelf) to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to my Mind that place of St. <hi>Paul, For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. VII. 14.</note> and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they Holy:</hi> Where Interpreters underſtand, by the unbelieving Husband or Wife, an Infidel; and by the Wife or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that ſanctifies, a Chriſtian; from whence I drew this Argument, That if Children, as ſoon as born, had a right to the Covenant by the Parents Faith, where but one of the Parents is a Chriſtian, then Baptiſm being
<pb n="XX" facs="tcp:101430:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Sign of the Covenant, and not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, (as the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> own,) It follows [by the Argument, <hi>à Majori ad Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, from the greater to the leſs</hi>] if the Child when born hath a right to the Covenant, he hath a right to the Sign;
<note place="margin">Omne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in ſe minus.</note> for according to the Logical Maxim, <hi>The greater includes the leſs;</hi> and he that ſhould deny this, would be as abſurd, as he that ſhould ſay, he that receiveth Ten Pounds receives not Five. And then I told him there were but two ſorts of Holineſs, with reference to Men, (though there may be a Relative Holineſs, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to things,) a Perſonal, and a Foederal Holineſs; at which he ſtared on me, as if he underſtood me not; on which I told him I would ſpeak more intelligibly, and that by Foederal, I meant a Covenant Holineſs: Now Children, antecedent to exerciſe of Reaſon, are not capable of a Perſonal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (which is a comprehenſive Word for all the Graces of Chriſtian Religion.)</p>

After I had given this Sence, I was told the reverend Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> had given the ſame Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Upon which I was pleaſed I had the
<pb n="XXI" facs="tcp:101430:17"/>concurring Judgment of ſo learned a Man. (Though I had not read it in him, or any elſe to my remembrance; but it was purely the ſuggeſtion of my own Mind, aſſiſted by the Divine Spirit, who is never wanting with his Grace to help thoſe that are ſincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Inveſtigation of, and Enquiry after Truth.) This is the main Subſtance (ſo far as my Memory will reach) of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours Diſcourſe we had: If I had had any Thought of printing it, I would have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed it while freſh in my Memory, and then poſſibly might have given a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account; but I hope this may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory, being as much as I can remember. Toward the end of our Diſcourſe I told him, if he could make appear he had anſwered any Argument of mine, or properly ſtated any for his Principles, I dare promiſe to yield the Cauſe; but to this (as I remember) he returned no Anſwer.</p>
            <p>After this was brought from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 14. I remember not I had any Anſwer; but he did as he uſed, make an Harangue to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And when he could neither anſwer my Argument, nor ſtate any proper for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he diverted to another Subject, and would needs enter into a Diſpute againſt Tiths: Upon which I deſired we might come to a better Concluſion about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Infant-Baptiſm, but I could have no further Diſcourſ on that Subject: But he requeſted me to ſhew him a place of Holy
<pb n="XXII" facs="tcp:101430:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scripture, in the New Teſtament, for Tiths; which I told him was unreaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſeeing our dear Redeemer, and his bleſſed Diſciples lived under <hi>Heathen</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, that were Enemies to Chriſtianity; and it could not be expected ſuch as were <hi>Gentile</hi> Rulers ſhould make Laws in Favour of the Chriſtian Religion: Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the Reaſonableneſs of Miniſterial Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. IX. 14.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>He that preacheth the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> But when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, he adopted Tiths into the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and then Tiths were to be paid under as high an Obligation of Conſcience, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were under by virtue of their Judicial Law, which was a part of their Theocracy, or the Government of God himſelf: So that a Man, who after ſuch an Obligation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds his Miniſter, either in whole or part, may be ſaid to be guilty of the Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> which they committed,
<note place="margin">Mal. III. 8.</note> (and it is well if none commit it in our days) who are ſaid directly to rob God; which they that love their Souls, believ a God, and a future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may tremble at the Conſideration of: Which made me wonder Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> ſhould tell me, he paid Tiths to a certain Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, (I think he ſaid one of the Reſidentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Chicheſter</hi>) but he did it (as he ſaid) againſt his Conſcience. Whereupon I told him he could not be an honeſt Man; becauſe he paid that voluntarily, which was againſt
<pb n="XXIII" facs="tcp:101430:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Conſcience: For any Man that payeth what he thinketh he ought not to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force, doth it voluntarily, becauſe he is under no Compulſion; and he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to that which he believes a Sin, though it be not, yet is a Sin to him; as the Author of <hi>The Whole Duty of Man</hi> informs us:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>in his Sermon at the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Mr.</hi> Gouge.</note> (the beſt of Books, as our learned, and moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Arch-biſhop calls it) Becauſe God judgeth according to our Wills, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Underſtandings. And now to pay my Adverſary all the Reſpect he may look for, and to do him all the Juſtice he can expect, I believe from the Fame I have heard, he could have diſputed like a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, more coherently, and congruouſly, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued more cloſely and properly; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Charity, I think I may ſuſpect he talked impertinently with a Deſign to put me in a Paſſion, (which I was ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, and therefore ſtood on my Guard; and that I might not be guilty of ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I implored the Divine Aſſiſtance to prevent my falling into the Indecencies, and Diſadvantages of Paſſion, becauſe. I knew from my natural Temper I had ſome Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereto) and that makes me think he did not believ the Character I have been told, he heard that Morning he came: For enquiring, whether I was a Man of Paſſion, he was anſwered I was not eaſily diſturbed, on which I was told he ſhook his Head. But I believe by his roving Talk he thought to
<pb n="XXIV" facs="tcp:101430:19"/>raiſe a Paſſion; (for nothing diſturbs a Man of Senſ more than impertinent Talk) and when that would not do, he fell to the mean Art of Flattery, by commending my Patience; and told me, after three hour's Diſcourſe, he had oft tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with Men of my Coat, but before ſo long time had been turned out of Doors: Upon which I told him, his impertinent Diſcourſe deſerved ſuch uſage; but I would not give him occaſion againſt me: For then I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he would go into the Town, and boaſt what a Victory he had obtained. But being he was there, I would inflict that Penance on my ſelf, as to diſcourſe till Bed-time, if he would ſtay, and then leav him; but I would have the Courage to meet him next Morning: For I now found where his Strength lay, which was more in evading an Argument, than in rightly ſtating one, or ſtanding to it, and learnedly defending it. After this Day's tedious Work (becauſe of the Impertinency I was troubled with) I ſaw him no more till <hi>New-Year</hi>'s Day, which hapned to be on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Feſtival en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to ſay ſomething of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. When Evening-Prayer was done, I ſent to Mr. <hi>M.C.</hi> where he held forth; and I think it was the firſt Day he did ſo in my Pariſh: He was ſo kind as to come, and brought two of my Neighbours of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. I treated them civilly, and after a while deſired them to withdraw; (becauſe I had a Mind to ſpeak with my Antagoniſt alone)
<pb n="XXV" facs="tcp:101430:19"/>which they did; when they were gon, and none but he and my ſelf, I told him, He might have the ſame ſuſpicion of me, I had of him, that when he and I diſcourſed before a Company, we might be tempted more to purchaſe Reputation, than to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, but now it was not in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's power to lay out ſuch a Temptation, there being none but he and I; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I deſired he would allow me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſomething calmly to him, which ſince reſulted to my thoughts; for I was willing to be his Proſelyte, if he could convince me to be in an Error; and as willing he ſhould be my Proſelyte, if I could prove him in a Miſtake: For though I loved the Church of <hi>England</hi> well, yet I loved Truth better; and if he could evince or prove ſhe had not Truth on her ſide, I would forſake her; but I could have no Anſwer; for he diverted to other diſcourſe, and ſaid we had ſpoke enough on the Argument. He hath ſince been with me, and deſired a Diſpute in the Church; I told him, I would meet him in any Church, if he would ſubmit to two Conditions, which I thought reaſonable; the one was, That he would get my Reverend Dioceſan's leave, or ſecure me from any Penalty the Biſhop, or the Law, might lay on me: The other was, That he would be at the Charge to hire an <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> to write down the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentativ part of his Diſcourſ, and I would be at as great a Charge to hire one
<pb n="XXVI" facs="tcp:101430:20"/>that ſhould write down what I offered, and then at the end of our Conference, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhould be expoſed to the conſideration of the moſt Judicious Auditors, to examine which ſpoke moſt according to the true Senſ of Holy Scripture, or the dictates of right Reaſon; but this offer he refuſed, and ſaid he would have nothing writ on either ſide: And the cauſe why I would engage him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was, becauſe it would be a kindneſs, in that it would be a great Caution, we ſhould ſpeak properly, and would oblige us to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and care, from the conſideration and fear of that ſhame and reproach we ſhould be expoſed to, by delivering our ſelves inconſiſtently and incoherently, and it would be a ſatisfaction to the People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we ſhould uſe our endeavours to ſpeak Truth, and to confirm it by Reaſon, which, if we did, it might have a good effect on the People that heard it, to underſtand who ſpoke moſt properly, according to the ſenſe of Holy Scripture, and ſo conſequently who had the cleareſt Truth on his ſide; but no Argument would prevail with him to ſubmit to ſuch reaſonable terms; and then I told him, I would allow him to tell, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to accept his Challenge: But then I deſired him to tell on what terms I denied to comply; or if not, I ſhould take care to do it; and then he would have cauſe not to be ſatisfied with, but aſhamed of the Report. When he was with me, on New-years-day,
<pb n="XXVII" facs="tcp:101430:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>1688. I told him I underſtood that was the firſt day he Held-forth in his Meeting-place, and I ſuppoſed he ſpoke againſt our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and truly the Feſtival engaged me to ſay ſomething in defence of our declared Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. I ſaid, I doubted he truſted to ſuch an Extemporary <hi>Effuſion,</hi> and ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Meaſure of the Holy Spirit, that I thought he could give little Account of what he ſaid after he concluded; but I told him, I hoped I truſted as much to the Holy Spirit as he, in a rational way; for I ſtudied for what I delivered, and then I implored the Divine Bleſſing on what I ſtudied, which I thought as much as I ought to truſt to; for I believe, ſince the Miraculous Aids of the Holy Ghoſt are ceaſed, the Divine Spirit doth afford his Bleſſing in the uſe of means, and not in an extraordinary manner; and then I read what I ſpoke in reference to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm, which I deſired him to cenſure as ſeverely as he pleaſed, provided he would give me a Reaſon: The Account whereof is as followeth, Preaching that day on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Circumciſion, from <hi>Gen.</hi> XVII. 9.15. I made this Obſervation, That Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Proſelytes, and their Infants, were made Partakers of God's Covenant; whence I thus argued in the General for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: If this be underſtood, it will afford a ſtrong, though not uſually brought-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Baptizing of Infants: For if this be true, as may be made appear by <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
               <pb n="XXVIII" facs="tcp:101430:21"/>Cuſtoms, it is plain not being of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but being of the Faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> gave a Perſon a right to the Covenant, and to the Sign of it, Circumciſion; or elſe no Proſelytes could be made from Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, and ſo admitted into Covenant by that Sign; and then by Parity of Reaſon, the Faith of the Chriſtian Parent ſhall be imputed to the Child: And if the Faith of the Parent gives a Title to the Covenant, or being a Chriſtian, (Baptiſm, like Circumciſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Sign of the Covenant,) by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Reaſon, the Faith of the Parent (as I have hinted) gives a right to the Sign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sign is leſs than the Privilege. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no being a Diſciple of Chriſt, without being Baptized into his Bleſſed Name, that being the Sign of the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Covenant, and made as neceſſary as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which was the Sign of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Law; not that I would be ſo uncharitable, as to Damn all that die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; becauſe it is here as in Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Infant can be in no fault, as not being capable of Obedience to the Command, or tranſgreſſing the Law by contempt; and ſo cannot be ſaid to break the Covenant, that doth nothing belonging to the keeping it; and though the Child did not,
<note place="margin">Ezod. IV. 24.</note> yet <hi>Moſes</hi> the Father of the Child went in danger of his Life, whom the Lord met by the way in the Inn, and ſought to kill; which, if duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, might make all Chriſtian Parents,
<pb n="XXIX" facs="tcp:101430:21"/>that neglect the bringing their Children time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Baptiſm, tremble for fear of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment falling on themſelves; which may be one reaſon, why our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Church declares in the Rubrick of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm, and enjoyns the Paſtors and Curates of every Pariſh, oft to admoniſh the People, that they deferr not the Baptiſm of their Children longer than the firſt or ſecond Sunday, or other Holyday, next after the Child be born: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs on a great and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Cauſe declared to the Curate, and to be by him approved.</hi> Moreover, if there be no enjoying the Benefits of the Covenant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sign, this makes the Sign neceſſary; and the wilful neglect of neceſſary means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers any Perſon's Salvation, without the Interpoſition of an extraordinary Mercy; and that which is above, or beyond means, is ever miraculous: And if ſuch a miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Mercy were indulged, as oft as ſuch a wilful neglect gave occaſion, it would ceaſe to be miraculous; becauſe a Miracle is not only an extraordinary act of Power, but a rare contingency, and therefore cannot oft happen; otherwiſe the Sun's daily motion about the Earth, would be as great, if not a greater Miracle, than its once
<note n="*" place="margin">Joſh X. 12, 13. 2 Kin. XX. 9, 10, 11.</note> ſtanding ſtill, or once Retrograde Motion. Laſtly, let it be conſidered, that our Adverſaries think Chriſtian Inſtruction neceſſary, before the admiſſion of the Party to Baptiſm, and we think it neceſſary afterward, ſuppoſing the
<pb n="XXX" facs="tcp:101430:22"/>Party liveth to years of diſcretion; and if not, we have more reaſon to rely on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary act of Mercy, that have given the Sign, and all the Party is at preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, (and being alſo what the Party was commanded to ſubmit to, under a previous diſpenſation, and which was never prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; and alſo ſuch an one as was Typical of the Diſpenſation we are under,) than they have to depend on a miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Mercy, who will not uſe what the Child is capable of, nor give it that Sign to which the Benefits of the Covenant are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
<note place="margin">

               </note> and without which they are not to be enjoyed. Alas! poor helpleſs Children, that their Parents ſhould be ſo unmerciful, as not to allow them as much Pity, as God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth Mercy; and refuſe that Sign of the Covenant, God hath appointed as the only conveyance of the Advantages thereof; and deny them thoſe means God hath inſtituted, as the Title to make over the Bleſſings of Heaven, and convey that Happineſs that is only to be enjoyed in the Manſions of Glory above. A great part, if not moſt, of this, hath been urged in a Conference for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing this conſiderable, becauſe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Truth, the neceſſity of Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; which if it had been weighed, and the force of its Reaſon examined, (as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the matter required,) there had been no cauſe for that which I have been more than once told of, I mean unreaſonable,
<pb n="XXXI" facs="tcp:101430:22"/>becauſe undecent ſinging <hi>Io Paans,</hi> and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boaſting Triumphs before the Victory, by Men that had rather ſerve a Faction, and an Intereſt, than promote that Religion that is tru, becauſe rational, and love their Reputation more than their Conſcience, and value their Credit and Honour more than the Truth in Sincerity; or to uſe an Holy Scripture Phraſe, (and an Expreſſion by them much delighted in, and as much abuſed, and wreſted to the deceiving the unthinking many) <hi>The Truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi> This I read, and asked what he had to ſay: He gave me no other Anſwer than this, that he thought I was a Man underſtood my Principles. I thanked him for his Candor; and told him I was not fit to be a Public Inſtructor if I did not: And then I added I would make ſome Enlargements to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I ſhewed him, and would print it if he would give me a Civil and Rational Anſwer.</p>
            <p>To which he returned, I might do as I pleaſed; but he would have nothing to do with me in Print, becauſe (as he ſaid) I underſtood my Principles; which was an Intimation he would have nothing to do with any in Print, but ſuch as he thought he could confute.</p>
            <p>But to do Juſtice; When I read the Paper, I told him of the Boaſtings I heard he made of the Victory he had obtained. He aſſured me he had not ſaid any ſuch thing; but pretended a reſpect for me: Yet I have
<pb n="XXXII" facs="tcp:101430:23"/>reaſon to ſuſpect he might under-hand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch Reports (for I am inclined to believe he is not a Man of that Perfection, but he may be tempted to, and without breach of Charity, I may ſuppoſe him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to entertain with a ſort of Pleaſure ſome little Titillations of the Animal Life, to uſe the <hi>Platonic</hi> Phraſe, which the beſt Men may be too propenſ to) if what I have heard be true; for I was told by a Neighbour-Miniſter, that one in his Pariſh who was an <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt,</hi> told him he had an excellent Gift of Praying: And he hoped to have an excellent Gift of Preaching. Whereupon he asked, if he had heard of me, and the Conference I had with their great Man, and reputed Biſhop. He anſwered, yes, and ſaid I was a Man of great Noiſe, but little Senſ: I am content for once that pert Fellow ſhould make a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Skill on me, and employ his little Learning and Art about me; and if he can prove his Charge, I will be ſatisfied patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bear the reproachful Accuſation. He added, Their <hi>Goliah,</hi> their great Champion had ſo baffled me, that I had not the Courage to appear before him. But I will entertain ſuch candid Thoughts of Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> as to believe he will not give ſo mean a Character of me as this Thraſonic Fellow hath. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was a little after at a Market-Town, where I heard he was; and when I found him, I told him I would give him any thing
<pb n="XXXIII" facs="tcp:101430:23"/>the Houſe afforded, (for I had a Mind to acquaint him what his wiſe Admirer ſaid of him and me) if he would be ſo kind as to allow me a little Diſcourſ with him; but he anſwered he could not then ſpare time. Thus I have given as tru and fair an Account as poſſibly I could of the Conference, as my Memory would ſerve to relate of what was done ſome Years ago. If any ask why I did not publiſh it ſooner; the Reaſon is, becauſe I was willing to preach it to my People before I publiſhed it.</p>
            <p>And that I did not, nor could do it till this Summer, there were ſome Reaſons I think not neceſſary to publiſh. I find a Poet tells of an Author who was ſo exact in the compoſing a piece of Work, that he was nine Years before he publiſhed it.</p>
            <q>—Nonumque prematur in Annum. <bibl>Horat.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>I muſt confeſs I was not ſo exact as to ſpend half the time in the compoſure of this Treatiſe, tho' it hath not appeared till now. I have endeavoured to treat my Adverſary with Reſpect; for I had much rather perſuade and convince the Judgment by Arguments of Reaſon, than exaſperate an angry Humour, or raiſe a Paſſion by a petulant Expreſſion. If any of the Adverſ Party ſhall judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged, in vindication of a weak and almoſt baffled Cauſe, to make a Return: If they will do it candidly and ingenuouſly, like Scholars or Gentlemen, they ſhall be
<pb n="XXXIV" facs="tcp:101430:24"/>entertained with the ſame Civility in my Reply. But if they ſhall anſwer with Noiſe and Nonſenſe, impertinently, or in a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque way, I acquaint them I affect not <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Employment; and time doth not ſo hang on my Hands, that I have any to expend in catching Flies; and I had rather bear with their buzzing, than be ſo diverted from Buſineſs. And truly I was willing to treat my Adverſaries kindly, and manage this Controverſie with Plainneſs for the Reaſons the learned Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> gives,
<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker<hi>'s excellent Preface to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Plea for Infant-Baptiſm.</hi>
               </note> to whom I refer my Readers.</p>
            <p>And as I have not committed any voluntary Error in this Relation; ſo I have taken Care in the Book it ſelf to write with ſo much Plainneſs, that if perchance I have uſed a difficult Term, I have adjoined a Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Word to explain my meaning. And becauſe ſome of my People have deſired I would print all I preached on the Subject of Infant Baptiſm, I will here tranſcribe one or two Papers which I uſed before I came to my main Argument; and then with this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and what is in the Book, I ſhall have delivered what not only my ſelf, but others of far greater Judgment (if they do not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me) think neceſſary to be ſaid on the Subject, according to the Method I have handled it in, and the Topicks I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by. What I ſaid next, was, when I had occaſion to preach on that former Text, and quoted 1 Cor. VII. 14. I thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="XXXV" facs="tcp:101430:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>my ſelf: Give me leave now to ſay ſomething in defence of Infant-Baptiſm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to ſeize on any Opportunity that inviteth me to ſpeak thereof. For being there is a Sect of Men called <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> that have ſet up a Meeting in this Pariſh to ſeduce Men from the Ancient Truth, I think it my Duty (out of kindneſs to your Souls Health) to preſerve you in the true and Catholic, becauſe Chriſtian Doctrin of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Infants, that you may, by defending your Orthodox Principle of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> be able to Anſwer ſome of their weak (though they imagine them ſtrong) Arguments.</p>
            <p>If then that be true, which I do not in the leaſt doubt, (having no reaſon for it,) that the Learned <hi>Rabbins</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> acquaint us with, (who beſt underſtood their Uſages,) That one Reaſon of Circumciſion, was to teach the derivation of God's Covenant to the Seed of the Faithful. This place of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s will hint us a ſeemingly unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Argument for Infant-Baptiſm, which with an allowable confidence, and without too much conceitedneſs of my ſelf, (for I have laboured to mortifie ſuch Inclinations,) I may challenge the moſt Learned <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt</hi> in this Country, or poſſibly in the Kingdom, to give any tolerable Anſwer to, or to offer any Senſ of this Text, different from what I ſhall now deliver, as its true meaning, provided it be according to the
<pb n="XXXVI" facs="tcp:101430:25"/>Teſtimony of Holy Writ, the Connexion of Sacred Scripture, the Analogy of ſound Faith, and the clear Dictates of right Reaſon. I call this Doctrine an Ancient Practiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not in any meaſure Queſtion, but it was uſed in that Age of Chriſtianity next to the Holy Apoſtles, which is as ſoon as we could expect it to be uſed; becauſe in the Holy Apoſtle's time, there was no one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought over to the Chriſtian Faith; but becauſe of the ſwift propagation of the Chriſtian Doctrin, we may reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there was ſuch a Converſion by the end of the firſt Century, or Hundred years after the Holy Apoſtles death;
<note place="margin">Viri Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolici.</note> and the Fathers of that Century were called Apoſtolic Men; and if you will not allow ſuch a Tradition to be Apoſtolic, I know not what Tradition can claim that Ancient and Honourable Name. And now I will give you the plain Senſ of that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s above-mentioned, ſuch as may confirm what I have before offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as its meaning, in a Conference on this Subject: <hi>For the unbelieving Husband is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Wife; and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband; i. e.</hi> the Paganiſh Husband is ſanctified by the Wife that is a Chriſtian, I mean her Foederal or Covenant Holineſs is imputed to the Husband, that the Children begotten and born after ſuch a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, may be Holy, or Partakers of a Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral or Covenant Holineſs: For a Perſonal Holineſs cannot be conveyed, (as ſome Men
<pb n="XXXVII" facs="tcp:101430:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ill Principles, particularly the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> think, for they believ the Perſonal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God and Chriſt may be tranſmitted, and therefore they declare a Man may be Godded with God, and Chriſted with Chriſt.) And ſo the Paganiſh Wife is ſanctified by the believing Husband. That no other ſenſe can be the proper meaning of this Text, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Context, which is the beſt way to have a right underſtanding of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, (or any other Book or Author,) as will appear by two verſes preceding, <hi>If any Brother hath a Wife that believeth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away; and the Woman which hath an Husband that believeth not, if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</hi> And then the Holy Apoſtle, as an encouragement for Co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a Reaſon why the Husband ſhould not Divorce the Wife, or the Wife forſake the Husband, adds the following Words, <hi>for the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> which being ſo great a Priviledg ſhould be a Motive to dwell together, and not by ſeparation to forfeit ſo conſiderable an Advantage; and when there is ſo plain Senſe in Holy Scripture for the Baptizing Infants, it is unreaſonable in the <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> to demand a poſitiv Precept of Holy Scripture in expreſs Words; and therefore having ſo much Reaſon on our ſide, grounded on the plain ſenſe of Holy Scripture, Why
<pb n="XXXVIII" facs="tcp:101430:26"/>may not we, with as much Reaſon retort on them, and demand a poſitiv Prohibition in expreſs terms? And ask, whether they can ſhew any Text in the whole Sacred Book of God, that ſaith, Infants ſhall not be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Having therefore ſo much Reaſon for our Principles, we may rationally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume we have the Holy Scriptures, ſeeing they never contradict Reaſon, though they may in ſome things tranſcend Reaſon; but I ſhall need ſay no more from this Text, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken ſo fully to it in the Book, to which I referr my Readers.</p>
            <p>I know but one Objection,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>An Obj.</hi>
               </note> I ſhall need to take notice of here (ſeeing I have anſwered ſo many in the Book, and in particular This, and therefore ſhall be the ſhorter in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I now give; and what I ſay, ſhall not be the ſame with that in the Book,) and this I am the more willing to, becauſe I know ſome of the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> think it may have ſome force in it, againſt our Principle, though few of them know how to manage it; and I confeſs it hath been ſtarted to me by one that knew not how to uſe it; and this they think the ſtronger, becauſe drawn from our acknowledged Principles; I mean from one of our authorized Books; and ſo they take it to be like the Logicians <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> as ſtrong as a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and ſo hope to gore us with our own Horns, and expect we ſhould ſay as the Apoſtate Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror

               </gap>ny more
<pb n="XL" facs="tcp:101430:27"/>to this, there being a much larger Anſwer in the Book. And now I have but one Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more to give of what I delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to my main Argument; and that I am willing to tranſcribe, becauſe it will the better prepare the way to thoſe Holy Scripture-Proofs I have offered in the Book, for evidencing the neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm. Preaching at the Feſtival of the Nativity of the Holy Jeſus, on that Text, <hi>Iſai.</hi> VII. 14. <hi>Therefore the Lord of Hoſts ſhall give you a Sign, behold a Virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Immanuel,</hi> I had an Occaſion to quote St. <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVIII. 19, 20. <hi>Go you therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost; teaching them to obſerv all things whatſoever I have commanded you: And, Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the World. Amen.</hi> I thus addreſſed my ſelf to my People; I beg leave to give you the tru Senſ of this Text, that you may not be ſeduced from any important Truth of the Chriſtian Religion: And this I am willing to do, becauſe the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> do ſo much triumph in, and boaſt thereof, as if it contained an unanſwerable Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-Baptiſm; but I will evidently ſhew, it hath no force for their purpoſe. And now I will clearly evince, and make out, That this Text they ſo much inſiſt on, hath nothing in it againſt our Principles:
<pb n="XLI" facs="tcp:101430:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>And this I will do by ſhewing what the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of this Text (they think ſo much for them) is, and the Deſign of Chriſt's Commiſſion to his Bleſſed Diſciples in theſe Words, which is the only proper way of coming to the knowledge of their tru Senſ, whereby you may underſtand this place doth not in the leaſt countenance their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Principle. Their Argument is, becauſe it is ſaid in the Commiſſion, <hi>Teach</hi> before they <hi>Baptize:</hi> Now how could Men underſtand a Religion, that could not be known but by Revelation, before they had a knowledge of the Revelation? That being the only way of making a diſcovery; and therefore it was neceſſary the Holy Apoſtles Commiſſion ſhould be ſo worded, that they might by their Inſtructions preach to the Heathen World that Holy Doctrin the Bleſſed Jeſus came from Heaven to reveal; and which could not be known but by ſuch a Publication: For it is impoſſible that Men could be made Partakers of the ſign of the Covenant, till they owned, and were admitted into the Covenant. For as the Covenant ſuppoſeth ſome Promiſe on God's part, ſo it engages to ſome Service on ours; and we have no Reaſon to expect the Priviledg, if we will not undergo the Service. So that with relation to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and the Deſign of the Commiſſion, (which as I have inſinuated, is the only way of coming to the knowledge of their tru
<pb n="XLII" facs="tcp:101430:28"/>meaning) the Senſ is plainly this: All Power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>Go you therefore, and teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them; i. e.</hi> ſeeing ſo great Power is delivered to me by the Father, I impart to you ſo much of that Power as is fit to be communicated, and as is neceſſary for the Meſſage I ſend you on, and the buſineſs I have entruſted you with, which is to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel all the World, and inſtruct all Nations in the Holy Doctrine I came from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Glory to acquaint you with. Now that this is the tru Senſ, appears from the following Words of the next Verſe, <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to obſerv all things whatever. I have commanded you;</hi> and then encouraging them with hopes that Succeſs ſhould never be wanting to the diligent performance of their Duty, <hi>And, Lo, I am with you always even to the end of the World. Amen.</hi> Now I do not at all queſtion, but if the Law had been as extenſive a Diſpenſation as the Holy Goſpel, <hi>Moſes</hi> their Legiſlator would have given ſuch a Commiſſion to Twelve Elders of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as our dear Saviour gave his Bleſſed Apoſtles, and ſaid, <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> Circumciſing <hi>them:</hi> But becauſe the Law was confined to <hi>Judea,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> God's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his peculiar People; therefore that could not be done: But ſuppoſing it might have been, I ſay ſuch a Commiſſion would have been no Argument againſt the Circumciſing
<pb n="XLIII" facs="tcp:101430:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Jewiſh Children; and by a rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, this Commiſſion of Chriſt to his Bleſſed Diſciples, can be no Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe it is directed only to thoſe that were not in Covenant, and had not the leaſt Inſtruction in that Holy Doctrin that was now revealed. For they that were in Covenant, had a Power of tranſmitting their Title and Intereſt in the Covenant to their Children; and it is not only uncharitable, but irreligious, to believe that becauſe the Holy Goſpel was a more extenſiv Diſpenſation than the Law, it was not as merciful an one. For our Adverſaries allow (and from Evidence of Revelation are forced) Children under the Law were admitted into Covenant; and then by Parity of Reaſon, why may they not under the Holy Goſpel? I am certain St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who I believe underſtood Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion much better than any of them) ſaith ſo in expreſs Words; for he maketh Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren holy as ſoon as born, tho' but one of the Parents were a Chriſtian, as I hope I have made unanſwerably appear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 14. <hi>For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband, elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy;</hi> and if ſo, they muſt have a Right to the Sign that conveyeth the Privileges of the Covenant, becauſe they actually have a Right to the Covenant by their Birth.</p>
            <pb n="XLIV" facs="tcp:101430:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And this may anſwer a ſeemingly ſtrong Objection of the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obj.</hi>
                  </note> That it is unreaſonable to admit thoſe into Covenant that are not capable of underſtanding the Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to ſay this Objection is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Righteouſneſs of God's Diſpenſations; which I might do, and prove it.</p>
            <p>It is a ſufficient Anſwer to this their great Objection,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note> That this Method of Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is reaſonable, becauſe according to the Laws of Heaven and Earth too. For all that underſtand Inſtituted Religion, own God did by Circumciſion admit Children into Covenant under the Law: <hi>And</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is circumciſed becometh a Debtor to keep the whole Law;</hi> which the Jewiſh Children were as uncapable of keeping, as Chriſtian Children are of the Holy Goſpel; and ſo the Objection lieth as ſtrong againſt Circumciſing, as Baptizing Children. And it is reaſonable according to the Laws of Men too: For it is well known to all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, that it is a common thing to admit a Child to an Eſtate by Guardians and Tutors, under ſeveral Conditions, which the Child cannot undertake the Performance of, till he come to that Age wherein he can exerciſe his Reaſon: And is it not full as reaſonable to admit Children, on certain Terms, to an Holy Goſpel Eſtate, as to a ſecular one,
<pb n="XLV" facs="tcp:101430:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>on Conditions they are uncapable of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And thus we have the Laws of Heaven, and Men too, againſt our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: Nay, we have three ſtrong Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to defend the Truth, if we know but how to wield and manage them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Holy Scripture, which is the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reaſon, which I may call the Sword of Nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Law, which I may name the Military Sword.</p>
            <p>And being thus ſecured with ſpiritual, natural, and material Armour, we may be ſo courageous as not to fear the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Attempts that ſhall be made againſt us; and may believ according to an Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Phraſe, very proper to our Caſe, that againſt Truth, and us too, while we hold the Truth and ſtick to ſound Principles, no Weapon formed ſhall proſper, or have its intended effect; and when I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered theſe three Accounts from the Pulpit in defence of Infant-Baptiſm, I was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if I could make the Senſe of this laſt Text, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVIII. 19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them:</hi> I ſay, if I could prove thoſe Words to be not only not for the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> but againſt them,
<pb n="XLVI" facs="tcp:101430:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>and for us, I did believe I ſhould ſay all was ſufficient to prove its Lawfulneſs from Holy Scripture. And meditating one Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I employed my Thoughts to give the Words ſuch a Senſ, and to juſtifie it when I had done: And in order thereto I did humbly, and fervently implore the Divine Aſſiſtance, and God (who is never wanting to help them, who with Humility and Faith addreſs themſelves to him) ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted this Account of the Text to my Mind, that I have offered in the following Papers; which when I had compoſed, I penn'd down, becauſe I was not willing to forget what my Thoughts had delivered as the proper meaning of the Text, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Judgment; and I made uſe of no Book, but the Greek Teſtament, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf in the Account the Original giveth of <hi>Acts</hi> II. 39. which with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VII. 14. I made uſe of, as collateral Proofs, to confirm the Senſ given: For I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev the comparing of one Place of Holy Scripture with another, one of the beſt ways of coming to its tru Meaning; which when I had drawn out, it made about two Sheets of Paper, which was all at firſt I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to print.</p>
            <p>But the Occaſion of enlarging it, was this: A Neighbour-Clergy-man (with whom I diſcourſed about the Senſ given of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> XXVIII. 19. and the Confirmation I brought from thoſe two other Places of Holy
<pb n="XLVII" facs="tcp:101430:30"/>Scripture beforementioned) acquainted me he had a Book of an ingenious <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt,</hi> that did ſeem to invalidate any Proof for Infant-Baptiſm from thoſe two Texts; which I deſired to read, and he lent me. When I came home, I did without prejudice peruſe what he had wrote, and at the firſt ſight I was ſomewhat ſurprized; but on conſideration, and retiring into my ſelf, I did find his Arguments againſt the Senſ I offered, were but weak, as I hope will appear to any impartial Reader by the Anſwer I have given. After I had done this, I reſolved to uſe all Means I could think of, or remember, to eſtabliſh the Senſ I had given of the Text, and accordingly read over ſome uſeful Treatiſes upon the Subject; and becauſe as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaith,

               </note> 
               <hi>An ingenious thing it is to own by whom we have profited,</hi> I will give an Account to whom I am obliged, and more particularly I ſtand engaged to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in his <hi>Reſolution of Six Queries;</hi> one whereof is about Infant-Baptiſm; the other is the Excellent Author of the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Which was one of thoſe caſes the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> did, out of a pious and excellent Deſign, engage his City Clergy to ſtate and reſolve for the ſatisfaction of Diſſenters, and to reduce them to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

            <pb n="XLVIII" facs="tcp:101430:31"/>
            <p>As for Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> I have uſed his words in a manner; and for the other, I have in moſt, if not in all places, altered his words, and taken his ſenſ, that I might adapt it to my own ſtyle, that the Work might look the more alike, and ſeemingly appear all of a piece. Something I have borrowed from Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>Paſtor and Clerk; or a Debate (real) concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Authorities I have uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſenſ delivered, I have not taken things on Truſt; but peruſed and examined good Editions of the Original Authors, and have been careful neither to miſ-report their words, nor miſrepreſent their ſenſ, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made this Ingenuous Acknowledgment, I cannot be accuſed of <hi>Plagiariſm;</hi> becauſe I give my Authors all the Reputation they can deſire, by owning what I have taken.</p>
            <p>And now, I hope, I may without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs, ſay, I have uſed all the proper Methods for reducing Gainſayers into the Paths of Truth and Peace: For beſides three Rational Arguments for Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, I have endeavoured to prove it from that place of Holy Scripture the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries think againſt it; and to engage the belief of the moſt averſ and pre-poſſeſſed, I have offered all the proper methods of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</p>

               <hi>Walker</hi> hath in part already evidenced, in the Poſtſcript to his excellent Book; and in particular tells us, that St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Fidus,</hi> hath not yet been demonſtrated to be illegitimate; and ſaith that this Author, even Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> owns not it is yet made out, no not ſo much as by Monſieur <hi>Daillé,</hi> who hath given the World the greateſt diſcovery of that kind; and we have good reaſon to believ it to be genuine; and good ground we have for ſuch a Belief; ſeeing it is allowed by Two Learned Doctors of the Church, St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> hath evidenced towards the end of his Book by two Quotations from them, to which I referr my Readers. And truly, I have been told by ſome of the Learned, that ſome worthy Perſons of our excellent Church, have challenged the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> to ſtand to the Tryal of Antiquity, and to appear for their Principles no farther than ſuch Authority will allow; but I have heard they have refuſed to ſubmit to ſuch a Teſt; and pretend they will not be convinced by any other Arguments (how ſtrong ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may not only appear, but really

            <p>And now, on the whole matter, I hope I may venture to ſay, if I have given the true ſenſ of Chriſt's Commiſſion to this Bleſſed Diſciples for the Adminiſtration of this Holy Sacrament of Baptiſm, and confirmed it by proper Proofs; and anſwered the ſtrongeſt Objections brought by the Adverſaries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſenſ delivered, in defence of the Orthodox and Chriſtian Doctrin of Infant-Baptiſm, than he who reſiſts ſuch Evidence renounceth his Belief of the Sacred Scriptures, the Revelation of the Holy Will of Heaven, and forfeits his Title to the honourable Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of Chriſtianity.

               </label> Therefore I will endeavour by way of Concluſion, and Anſwer, to remove that, and if I can ſhew the delays of Baptizings, which the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> ſo greatly inſiſt on in the ancient times, were on other Grounds from thoſe they alledg in the Caſe, and plead for a defence of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and miſtaken Principles; then that
<pb n="LVIII" facs="tcp:101430:36"/>Plea of theirs from the Practice of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Adult in the early Ages of the Church, and deferring the Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, will neither ſerve their Hypotheſis, or Principle, nor diſſerve ours. The Grounds, as I underſtand, on which our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> refuſe Baptizing of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and deferr their Baptiſm till they come to full Maturity, or Ripeneſs of Age, are, becauſe as they ſuppoſe, there is no Command in Holy Scripture for it, and becauſe there is no Example in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of its practice; either of which if there found, our Adverſaries would hold it lawful; and becauſe they find neither of them, they hold it unlawful. Now if it appear the Unlawfulneſs of Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants for the want of an Holy Scripture-Command, or Example, was none of the Grounds on which the Ancients did delay their Baptizings. And if it be likewiſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that never any ſuch thing was in the Primitiv Times pretended, or pleaded by any Perſons to juſtifie or excuſe that delay; then I hope the Caſe will be clear, that their delays of Baptizing, on other Grounds, can afford no Protection to, or Defence for the Hypotheſis, or Principle of our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſts,</hi> who deny Baptiſm to Infants on the Account of its Unlawfulneſs. That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſuch Plea was made by any in the Primitiv Times (even for Five hundred
<pb n="LIX" facs="tcp:101430:36"/>years) againſt Infants being Baptized, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally preſume, becauſe I find none yet produced by any of the moſt learned of our <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> who, I believe, have ſearched through all the Writings of the Ancient Fathers, and Eccleſiaſtic Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and ranſacked every Page, and rifled every paſſage in them, for ſome Patronage to their Hypotheſis, or Principle. And as they are quick-ſighted enough to have eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, if there had been Quotation, or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from them to have produced it in their behalf; ſo on the moſt curious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Enquiry I have been ever able to make, I profeſs I have not been able to find any.</p>
            <p>And then learnedly from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> he gives Eighteen or Nineteen Inſtances of ſeveral Caſes for the deferring of Baptiſm; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward brings in three or four other Caſes, which are all I think could be reckoned up. Upon which he ſaith, (that I may draw to a Concluſion) and now ſo many Reaſons being alledged for the delaying of Baptiſm, ſo many ſhifts uſed for the putting it off in the Primitiv Times, and yet the Lawfulneſs of its being adminiſtred to Infants never once queſtioned, the Unlawfulneſs of it never urged, it is a plain Caſe, that thoſe Times had no ſuch Thoughts of Infant-Baptiſm,
<pb n="LX" facs="tcp:101430:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>as the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> in our Days enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: For had they thought Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants unlawful, for want of an Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Command or Example, when any Perſons had been exhorted to an early Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing their Children, how eaſie an Anſwer had been at hand? The Holy Jeſus never commanded ſuch a thing as Infant-Baptiſm; the Bleſſed Apoſtles never practiſed ſuch a thing as the Baptizing Infants: There is neither Precept, nor Example in Holy Scripture; and therefore it is unlawful, and we dare not do it.</p>
            <p>But in regard there is in all thoſe times not the leaſt appearance of any ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, or of any ſuch Plea pretended for the delay; it is evident, they thought there was either Precept, or Example, in Holy Scripture, or both; or elſe that the want of either or both, did not make it unlawful; and ſo did not delay it on the Account of the Unlawfulneſs thereof: And ſo all our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paedobaptiſts</hi> boaſting of Antiquity for the Baptizing only Adult, Believing Perſons, and againſt the Baptizing Believers Infant-Children, affords them little Boaſt; there is not the leaſt ſtrength added to their Cauſe, nor weakneſs brought on ours.</p>

            <p>And now this grand prejudice is (as I hope) fully removed, and all Objections I can imagine any way conſiderable, have been endeavoured to be rationally and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered in the following Book, I ſhall now heartily deſire my Readers to join with me in the pious and devout Suffrage of our excellent Liturgy in the Office of the Litany.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Some Rational Arguments for</hi> Infant-Baptiſm.</head>
            <p>THE Argument I offer, in ſhort, is plainly this, which I will reduce into the form of a plain and proper Syllogiſm; That Principle which hinders the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Religion, can be no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine: But the denying Baptiſm to Infants, hinders the Progreſs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion; Therefore ſuch a Principle can be no Chriſtian Doctrine. The <hi>Major,</hi> all Chriſtians, even our Adverſaries, allow, but the making out the <hi>Minor</hi> is the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; for which I offer this Proof. That Principle which makes the Covenant of Grace leſs beneficial and extenſive, than the Covenant of Works, hinders the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian Religion: But the former Principle does ſo; Therefore ſuch a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hinders the Progreſs of Chriſtianity. The <hi>Major</hi> is undoubtedly ſo, and I will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101430:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>endeavour to make the <hi>Minor</hi> to be ſuch by this One Argument: That Principle which allows not as great Immunities, Benefits and Privileges to the Covenant of Grace, as to the Covenant of Works, makes the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace leſs Beneficial and Extenſive than the Covenant of Works: But the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that denies Baptiſm to Infants does ſo; Therefore it makes the Covenant of Grace leſs Beneficial and Extenſive than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works.

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The true Sence of the Holy Jeſus's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto his Bleſſed Diſciples for the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm. St.</hi> Matth. xxviij. 19. <hi>makes for the</hi> Baptizing of Infants.</head>
            <p>AND now I will endeavour to confirm theſe Arguments by the Authority of Holy Scripture; and prove, in particular, That that Text of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviij. 19. muſt have ſuch a ſence, as to evidence, That the Covenant of Grace (or elſe it would not be ſuch a Covenant, and ſo forfeit its Title) is full as (or rather more) beneficial and extenſive than the Covenant of Works; and conſequently, that the Baptizing Infants is a Chriſtian, as well as a Comfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is the Truth to be proved; and then it will plainly appear, this Text, our Adverſaries ſo much Glory in, and Vaunt of, is on our ſide. For if there had been as General a Commiſſion given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to Twelve Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Bleſſed Jeſus gave to his Diſciples, and it had been ſaid to them, <hi>Go teach all Nations, circumciſing them,</hi> this had been no Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Circumciſing the Jewiſh Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe there was a Poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101430:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>given them by Divine Revelation, and no After-Commiſſion could diſcharge from Obedience to ſuch a Command; And where the ſame Reaſon holds for the ſame Obſervation, under a different Diſpenſation, there is no neceſſity for the Publication of a New Command to enjoyn its Obſervance. Now there never was, ſince the Creation of the World, but two Inſtituted Religions that had Truth on their ſide, the Jewiſh, and the Chriſtian. And the Bleſſings that were conferred by either of theſe Religions, and the Duties and Services required to enſure and conſign the Bleſſings from the Party that was to beſtow them, to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were to enjoy them, were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, tranſmitted and conveyed in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting way. Now the Evangelic Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation being in a Covenanting way as well as the Legal one; thoſe that had a right to the Covenant under the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, had a right to the Sign, Seal, or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant, as well as thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. Hereupon that Children under the Holy Goſpel had a right to the Covenant, is not very difficult to prove from St. <hi>Mark</hi> x. 14. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God;</hi> i. e. the Kingdom of Grace: For in that ſence is that Phraſe of <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> in ſeveral places of Holy Writ, to be underſtood; and it plainly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that his Holy Goſpel-Diſpenſation (by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101430:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>which the Kingdom of God is meant) was as extenſive and mercifull as the Legal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and of which they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being Members; and having the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Bleſſings therein communicated, conſigned to them; which is true not only in reſpect of their Innocency and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; (for by reaſon of their Infantile State, they were not capable of actual and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sins, and ſo might, in ſome ſence, be fit for his Kingdom of Glory;) but becauſe alſo they were to be allowed an admiſſion into his Covenant, by virtue of an Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Parents Faith, as the Jewiſh Children were upon that account capable of being Members of the Covenant, and of receiving the Sign thereof, <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> So that by this Argument, which I doubt not is ſufficiently founded upon this place of Holy Scripture, whereby Chriſtian Children have as true a right to Baptiſm under the Holy Goſpel, as the Jewiſh Children had to Circumciſion under the Law; It may appear there is no neceſſity for an expreſs Place of Holy Scripture, (in ſo many words) for the Baptizing Children, when the reaſon of the thing is founded in Circumciſion, for which there was a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command. Now our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſubſtituted Baptiſm in the room of Circumciſion, for theſe two Reaſons, as may probably be conjectured.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:101430:44"/>
            <p>(1.) Becauſe he was the Author of a more Mercifull Diſpenſation; and that That might not be ſaid of the Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, which <hi>Zipporah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> iv. 25. <hi>Surely a bloody Husband art thou to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Becauſe he was the Author of a more extenſive Diſpenſation; and therefore he appointed a Sacrament, or Seal of his Covenant, that Females, as well as Males, might undergo: Whereas under the Legal Diſpenſation, Females were not capable of the Sign of the Covenant; and becauſe it was a more narrow Diſpenſation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſon, the Man being <hi>the Head of the Woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. xj. 3.</note> ſhe was included in, or comprehended under the Man, which there was no need ſhe ſhould be under the Evangelic Diſpenſation, that admitting a Sign, or Seal of the Covenant, ſhe was as capable of as the Man Thus, as our Bleſſed Saviour took his Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from the <hi>Poſtcoenium,</hi> or After-ſupper, after the Paſſover, (which as I have found in ſome Authors was only a Sallad of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Lettuce, and Succory,) ſo he took Baptiſm as the Sacrament of Initiating, or Entring Diſciples into his Evangelick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, (being well known among the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe it was the Ceremony for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Proſelytes into their Church;) That by taking both Sacraments from known uſages among the <hi>Jews,</hi> he might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101430:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>the more eaſily and powerfully reduce, and bring over his own beloved Country-men, the <hi>Jews,</hi> to his Holy Goſpel; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more gentle way of Entrance into his Church, might have a better Influence, and be more probably ſucceſsfull to the gaining the Gentile World to his New Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and to be profeſſors of his Sacred Inſtitutions, and obedient Subjects to his excellent Laws. And this did more ſuitably anſwer his Advent, or Coming into the World, who came to be an Univerſal Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for all Mankind. For <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a Legiſlator to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the <hi>Jews</hi> only; and yet on that account called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he delivered that People from their Enemies, and entred them into <hi>Canaan:</hi> But he that was to be an Univerſal Redeemer, and ſo the true Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the moſt extenſive ſignification of the word, thought fit to appoint ſuch a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Admiſſion into his Kingdom, as might work upon, and prevail with the whole World, even all Mankind</p>
            <p>Now from what hath been ſaid (and from a cuſtom among the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning Proſelytes of Juſtice, which all learned Men know to be ſo, and Men of Senſe among the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> acknowledge, that after ſuch a Proſelyte was Baptiz'd and Circumcis'd, and had thereby a Right to eat of the Paſſover, his Child born after ſuch an Admiſſion into the Covenant, had a Right to Circumciſion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101430:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>at Eight days old, as well as a natural-born <hi>Jew,)</hi> it may appear, that denying Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to Infants now, is an Hindrance to the Propagation of the Holy Goſpel both as to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> As to the <hi>Jew,</hi> becauſe he might ſay to an <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt,</hi> offering Arguments to perſwade him to become a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> He would not be of his Religion; becauſe, after he was in Covenant, and had received the Sign of the Covenant, his Child was not in Covenant, and ſo had no Right to the Sign, which he had in his Way by virtue of his Faith, and ſo conſequently the Benefit and Privilege leſs in ours, than in his Way. And ſo the <hi>Pagan</hi> might ſay to an <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt,</hi> perſwading him to embrace Chriſtianity; I will rather be a <hi>Jew,</hi> than a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe as ſoon as I own and profeſs their Faith, my Child, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a Declaration, is in Covenant as well as my ſelf, and hath a Right to the Sign. So that, by this account, it plainly appears, that the denying Infants Baptiſm, is an Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the Progreſs of the Holy Goſpel from Evidence of Reaſon. From whence it may ſeem rationally to follow, That he who holds any Principle that derogates from, and diminiſhes the Honour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and impedes the Propagation of the Religion of our dear Redeemer, hath no true and proper Right to the Honourable Name and Title of a Chriſtian, which is the natural and pernicious conſequence of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101430:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Antipaedobaptiſtic</hi> Tenets. So that how General ſoever the Commiſſion the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave to his Bleſſed Diſciples for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Heathen Nations, was, the ſence muſt be plainly this; (which, if I can ſecure by two other Texts of Holy Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by Alluſion to Jewiſh Cuſtoms, and by the Coherence, eſtabliſh by the Authority of the Ancient, Primitive Fathers, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſtrongeſt Objections of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, I ſhall ſay all that can be thought neceſſary by Men of Reaſon in defence of Infant-Baptiſm,) <hi>Go teach all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them; i.e.</hi> When you have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed the Pagan World in, and convinced them of the Excellency of my Holy Goſpel, and thereby perſwaded them to embrace my Divine Religion, my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip; and then, after a publick Profeſſion, they have declared themſelves my Diſciples and Followers, aſcertain them, that they are admitted into my Covenant of Grace, and receive them into, and give them a poſſeſſion of my Covenant by the Sign and Seal of Baptiſm; and then aſſure them, that their Children ſhall have the ſame Right to my Covenant that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-born Children of <hi>Jews</hi> have, and the Children of the Proſelytes of Righteouſneſs or Juſtice had after their Parents were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Jewiſh Religion.

            <p>IF Chriſtian Children, from the Sence I have delivered of this Text, be not as capable of Baptiſm, as the Jewiſh Children of Circumciſion; Upon what account ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Diſtinction? Not from the Nature of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, for that, as to the material part, was the ſame with ours made over to us by the Holy <hi>Jeſus;</hi> Nor from the manner of Conveyance, for Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did ſignifie the ſame thing under the former Diſpenſation, as Baptiſm under the latter: And hereupon, ſeeing the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101430:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>were, for the Nature of them, alike, and only a diſtinction in the manner of Conveyance, why ſhould any barr lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Admiſſion of Children now, more than formerly? Is Baptiſm an higher ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized Rite, than Circumciſion? That is not poſſible, becauſe Circumciſion is an Evangelic Inſtitution; I mean an Inſtitution of that Doctrine which was to <hi>Abraham</hi> delivered of old. And if the Spirituality of outward Ordinances is to be drawn from the deſign of their Appointment, then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was as much ſpiritualized as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, becauſe it truly ſeals the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and aſſures the ſame Grace, and was a Rite of Admiſſion for the ſame ſpiritual ſtock of the Father of the Faithfull, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is among us. Hereupon, if Circumciſion as a Sacrament was the ſame formerly that Baptiſm is now, it muſt be conſequent, That Infants now are as capable of the One (provided there is no Precept <hi>[de novo]</hi> (or a new) to exclude them) as formerly they were of the Other. If it were not abſurd that Children then were allowed to be Members of the Church, why ſhould it be ſo under the Holy Goſpel? If the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty allowed them under the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to be imbodied into the Church, (without a Precept to forbid them,) there is reaſon they ſhould be allowed the ſame favour now: Nay, if Children were made Members of the Church when the Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101430:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>was more harſh, how irrational is it not to allow them an Entrance now, when the way of Admiſſion is more ſuitable to the Tenderneſs of an Infant? Surely, if Jewiſh Children were Circumciſed by blood made with hands, Chriſtian Children (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Prohibition of Holy Scripture) ſhould be allowed the Spiritual Circumciſion, which is Baptiſm. Whom the Lord hath admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an Heir to the Glory above, and given an Intereſt in his Church below, no Man ſhould dare to hinder his Title that ſeals the Inheritance, and offers the Privilege. But yet ſo impertinent and cenſorious have ſome <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> been,

So that upon this Hypotheſis, or Suppoſition, That Children are not fit to be Baptized, the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> generally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That admitting Children to it is a reproach to the Sacrament, a very Nothing, an uncommanded Duty, and thereupon, in contempt, term it <hi>Baby-Baptiſm,</hi> as I have heard ſome of them phraſe it; (though, in truth, the ſtrongeſt Arguments I have heard from them, or met with in their Books, may more properly be called, a <hi>Baby,</hi> than a <hi>Manly</hi> Defence of their miſtaken Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;) Not remembring at the ſame time,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101430:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>that Circumciſing Children was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Sacrament of Admiſſion into the Jewiſh Church, but had a proper ſence and ſignification; ſo that the <hi>Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> might as well ſay there was <hi>Baby-Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Baby-Baptiſm,</hi> under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, both being uſed to Children among that People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The main Argument they offer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it is drawn from Childrens unfitneſs for ſome Purpoſes of that Ordinance, which can be performed by none, but ſuch as are Adult, who have the uſe of Reaſon to know the terms of the Covenant they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, and to exerciſe the Graces proper for that Ordinance, and to confirm thoſe Graces by ſuch an Exerciſe; but Children cannot undertake theſe things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not be allowed the uſe of that Ordinance, whoſe deſign is ſo much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Application thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this Argument, or Objection, how pleaſing ſoever at firſt ſight, is not good.</p>
            <p>(1.) Becauſe it is deceitfull in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and therefore the Concluſion will not hold.</p>
            <p>(2.) Becauſe it is a reflection upon ſome of the former Diſpenſations of the Wiſeft Being.</p>
            <p>(1.) Becauſe it is deceitfull in its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and therefore the Concluſion will not hold; and that for a Reaſon I find ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101430:49"/>by a Learned Man in his Excellent Tract, called <hi>The Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> which is ſo ſtrong, that if well underſtood, would fully anſwer, if not for ever ſilence this Objection. His Reaſon is this: Becauſe this way of arguing takes away the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a ſtrict Inſtitution, which is appointed to anſwer one or more Purpoſes, and particularly for perſons of one kind; and an Inſtitution of Latitude, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſeveral Purpoſes, and for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of Perſons differently qualified for thoſe ſeveral Purpoſes. Of the firſt kind was the Inſtitution of Fringes, which could only be worn properly by thoſe that were Adult, becauſe they alone were fit to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the deſign of their appointment, <hi>viz.</hi> To look upon them, and remember the Commandments of the Lord: And theſe you may ſuppoſe were thoſe Phylacteries the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did wear; and becauſe they were Oſtentatious Men, affected to make them broader than others; which Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Diſſimulation our Bleſſed Saviour, the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> did ſeverely reprove in them, and tartly upbraid them for and with. And of the other kind is the Sacred Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Matrimony, which was Inſtituted by Heaven for ſeveral Purpoſes, and for thoſe that are differently qualified and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for thoſe ſeveral Purpoſes, inaſmuch as Perſons that are not fit for ſome Purpoſes, may yet lawfully enter into that State of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101430:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>Life, becauſe they are fitted for other ends thereof. All the Purpoſes for which it was Inſtituted, cannot be performed, but by ſuch as are paſt the Age allowed by all for the begetting Infants; yet ſuch as have out-grown thoſe years, are not wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for that State; Nor is their Matrimony of no force, or an Impeachment of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Inſtitution of Matrimony, becauſe they are only fitted for one Purpoſe, for which Matrimony was Inſtituted; and that is the laſt End for which our Excellent Church tells us Marriage was Ordained, <hi>viz.</hi> the mutual ſociety, help and comfort the one ought to have of the other in proſperity and adverſity. This one Inſtance declares how deceitfull our Adverſaries Argument is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the admitting Children to Baptiſm, becauſe of their unfitneſs for ſome Purpoſes for which it was Inſtituted, they ſhould firſt offer a Proof for what they would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but have no reaſon to expect, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a Sacred Appointment of the former kind, which I term a ſtrict Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then their way of arguing would hold: But this I am well ſatisfied they can never do, becauſe that Ordinance came in the place of Circumciſion, which was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Appointment of the ſecond kind; and becauſe the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> underwent Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in whom there was more unfitneſs than there could be in Children. The <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> in truth, uſed the Baptiſm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101430:50"/>and thereupon aſſured the World of the Pardon of Sins; and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, knowing our dear Saviour ſtood in no neceſſity thereof, was not willing to admit him to it. St. <hi>Matth.</hi> iij. 14. <hi>But John forbad him, ſaying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> But our Bleſſed Saviour returned ſuch an Anſwer as ſatisfied him, in the next Verſe; <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now:
<note place="margin">Mat. iii. 15.</note> for thus it becometh us to fulfill all Righteouſneſs:</hi> i.e. It is juſt and equitable that I (who being now Thirty years old, and ſo qualified by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law to Preach, ſhould enter upon my Public Miniſterial Office, and being I intend Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as the Sacrament to admit Members to my Church) ſhould undergo that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance my ſelf, being the Head of my Church, which may be a good Reaſon why our mercifull Redeemer would not be Baptized before, and may ſatisfie ſuch of the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> (for ſome of them have urged it to me) as would from thence draw an Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm; and beſides, [it is like the Logicians <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi>] it is againſt themſelves; for it is well known, that ſometimes they Baptize perſons before that Age. And this Account plainly ſignifies, That the Ordinance of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Chriſtian Church, is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Appointment of Latitude; and that in ſuch Appointments, the unfitneſs of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to ſome Purpoſes, doth not unfit him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101430:50"/>for the Ordinance, when he is qualified for others.</p>
            <p>(2.) Becauſe it is a reflection upon ſome of the former Diſpenſations of the Wiſeſt Being: For it was the Appointment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that Infants ſhould undergo Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, though all the Purpoſes of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance could not be performed but by ſuch as were grown to years of diſcretion, who were only fit to know the Meaning of the Appointment, and the Obligation of the Covenant they were admitted unto. So that this Argument is as much againſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing, as Baptizing Children; becauſe Circumciſing them was appointed for the ſame Purpoſes, as that uſed in our Church: And hereupon, when Men were by that Sacrament received into the Church, they were to believe in God, and repent of any breach of his Laws, and openly to diſown any Idolatrous Belief, or Practice, and even to forſake their Idolatrous Relatives and Acquaintance; and yet, on the Requeſt of thoſe Proſelytes, their Children were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and Circumciſed, and thereby admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Church, though they were wholly ignorant of thoſe duties their Parents undertook the performance of. Hereupon ſuch who oppoſe Baptizing Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it agrees not to all the Uſes of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, vilifie the Wiſdom of God, and undervalue the Wiſdom of the Eccleſiaſtic Governors among the <hi>Jews;</hi> not weighing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101430:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>with themſelves, that Circumciſing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren then, and Baptizing them now, is an Appointment of great Latitude, intended by Heaven for Infants, in whom there is a a fitneſs for ſome; nay, the principal uſes of that Ordinance, as well as for grown Perſons, to whom all are fit.

For their Infancy is no barr, but they may be accounted Parts of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101430:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>Church, as well as Members of any different Company, or Society, of congregated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; Nor does it any more hinder them from being the adopted Sons and Daughters of Heaven, than it denies them a Right to any Earthly Poſſeſſion; nor of being the Inheritors of Everlaſting Happineſs by force of ſuch Adoption, than by force of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civil Adoption, the Inheritors of an Earthly Eſtate. For Infants are fitted for all Teſtimonies of Honour and Favour from God and Men, and of having a Title to the Benefits of any Company, though they are not able to diſcharge the Services thereof, nor know the leaſt matter of them. Since therefore Infants are as fit to receive, and do as greatly want almoſt all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the New Covenant, and the Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Church-ſociety as grown perſons; Is it not as reaſonable that the Seal, which confirms thoſe Advantages and Immunities, ſhould be given to one, as well as the other?

Or to give you another Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rude, that may more properly ſuit our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe: Imagine a King ſhould order an Attainted.

My Pity for him is great, and here I give him a Title to his Blood and forfeited Eſtate; and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſhall have as proper a Right as if his Anceſtor had not been Attainted: I heartily pardon him, and hereby publiſh, that I take him into my Favour; and that no ſtain may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, I do in the preſence of you, called together, ſprinkle him with clean Water, to ſhew that he is purged from all Guilt upon his own, or his Father's account.</hi> Now imagine this tranſacted for an attainted Infant; Will any declare, that what is done ſignifieth nothing, and is of no force, becauſe the Infant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it not? or that he was not fit for the Sign, when he was fit to be cleanſed from the Guilt tranſmitted to him by his Parent, and had his Eſtate re-convey'd to him, which was the Principal matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignified? What I have now offered, ought to be ſeriouſly weighed by thoſe that are Adverſaries to the Baptizing of Children,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101430:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>to whom I might propoſe the Precedents of Circumciſion and Baptiſm uſed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> both which (as I ſhall ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) were uſed for Children, as well as for the full-grown under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: And hereupon, though the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full did believe, and openly own that his Belief before Circumciſion; yet I preſume the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> will not acknowledge, That the Wiſeſt Being did imprudently in laying Circumciſion upon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> before he knew the Intent of the Ordinance, or could Actuate Faith, or make declaration of it.

               <hi>Obj.</hi> If any of the Adverſaries to this Principle ſhall ſay, All that I have offered doth not amount to a Command for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Children, or in expreſs words.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I will give a ſhort (yet I hope full) Anſwer: There is no need (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what hath been already ſaid to prove it) there ſhould be a Command, or Example, to approve the Uſage of admitting Children to Church-memberſhip in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is enough to make it practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the New Diſpenſation, that it is not any-where in Holy Scripture prohibited.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101430:53"/>Nay, as I may poſſibly take occaſion to ſhew hereafter, there is greater ground to believe, that Chriſtians ought to have had a direct Precept to let alone the Cuſtom of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Children into the Church; Becauſe it was expreſly enjoyned by God in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing Children, and had his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Baptizing Children (which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſuper-added unto their Circumciſing Children) under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: Precepts are ordinarily delivered, when a New Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is introduced, which was not formerly uſed to be done; But to vindicate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a formerly-appointed, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Cuſtom, it is enough, That the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which did appoint and allow it, doth not prohibit or revoke his former Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this being the Original Caſe of allowing Children a Right to the Covenant, and by a Sacramental Rite admitting them to the Poſſeſſion of the Benefits of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the Admiſſion of Children into the Church under the New Diſpenſation by Baptizing them, muſt by a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be enjoyned, or approved of. And if the Caſe be thus, as undoubtedly it is, then Fathers, Guardians, and Undertakers for Children, are obliged by indiſpenſible Duty to offer them to be Baptized in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Church's Authority. For the Church is a Company of perſons in Covenant with Heaven; and in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as in Humane Societies, there are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101430:53"/>ſuch as give forth Rules, and ſuch as practiſe thoſe Rules; ſuch as enjoyn, and ſuch as ſubmit: And hereupon, if the Univerſal Church, or any part thereof, enjoyneth her Members, the practice of any Doctrine, not forbidden by an higher Power, which muſt be the God of Heaven, they are obliged by the known Rules of all well-governed Societies, and by the Commands of the New Diſpenſation (which hath a reſpect unto Church-Government) to ſubmit to, and practiſe her Precepts, as the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſerts, Chap. xiij. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they do watch for your Souls.</hi> And for this end it was that we find the Holy Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when he travelled the <hi>Grecian</hi> Countries, giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> the Orders which the Holy Apoſtles had decreed at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But there is no neceſſity of ſpeaking further to Evidence this Truth, which all <hi>Separatiſts</hi> from our Excellent Church do allow: For though they diſagree amongſt themſelves, as well as diffent from us, as to the ſubject of true Eccleſiaſtic Juriſdiction; yet they all own there is ſuch an Authority; and that all Precepts enjoyned thereby, if not contrary to the Laws of Heaven, ſhould be ſubmitted unto; which will force our Adverſaries (from their own acknowledged Conceſſions) to allow the Lawfulneſs of Infant-Baptiſm, or recede from, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101430:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>one of their owned Principles; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which, I fear, they will be willing to do, though, in Reaſon, they ought to do one of them.</p>

From the Expoſition I have delivered, it is not a proper Queſtion for the <hi>Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> to ask, Whether the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath appointed Children to be admitted unto Baptiſm; but, Whether they are by him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or denied it: Becauſe upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Children to be not only Circumciſed, but Baptized, it will neceſſarily follow, That a Precept delivered by the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> to admit Diſciples from all Parts of the World, to his Holy Inſtitution, will, without a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, be interpreted to include Children, as well as the Adult. As for inſtance: Imagine our dear Redeemer had not altered the Sign, but in the room of Baptiſm had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101430:54"/>to his Followers, <hi>Go, teach all Nations, Circumciſing them.</hi> Now I make appeal to the Conſcience of any conſidering Perſon, whether by ſuch terms it can be ſuppoſed the Children of ſuch as were Proſelyted from Heatheniſm, could be denied Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and then what ground is there from ſuch Expreſſions, that our mercifull Saviour deſigned the Children of ſuch as were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Paganiſm, the being Baptized? This is ſo reaſonable, that it was neceſſary the Commiſſion ſhould be ſo expreſſed: For who can ſuppoſe, but that they who were Enemies to the Inſtitution of the Holy <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> were to be firſt inſtructed, and made Diſciples before they were admitted to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? For imagine a Commiſſion ſhould be given to certain Men, among whom Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is cuſtomary, <hi>Go, and teach the Indians, baptizing them.</hi> Can any one believe the deſign of it was to barr the Children of thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> from being Baptized, when Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Children was an uſual Cuſtom among thoſe to whom the Commiſſion was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? So that this being the clear ſence of the Commiſſion, the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> could not well expreſs it in words more plain, and eaſie to be underſtood by his own People, to whom he ſpake; for they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily apprehend thoſe capable of Church-fellowſhip under the New Covenant, that were allowed it under their own Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Common ſence would oblige them
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101430:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>to interpret the words according to their known Cuſtom. Moreover, with what ſence can any perſon ſuppoſe, that he who drew ſeveral Appointments from the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould leave out this, and in this alone vary from what the <hi>Jews</hi> practiſed, when there was Reaſon for the Continuance: Children are as capable of the Seal of Divine Grace, and of the Advantages thereof now, as they were under the former Diſpenſation; There is as much Reaſon for the Baptizing them now, as for the Circumciſing and Baptizing them formerly; Their Admiſſion under the Law, and Holy Goſpel, have ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Reaſon in it; and though the Seal be changed, the Covenant continues. In ſhort, there was no engagement on our mercifull Redeemer to diſuſe the Cuſtom of Baptizing Children, as being diſagreeable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, Catholic and Generous Notion of his Divine Inſtitution. And ſurely theſe things, being duly weighed, there is much greater ground to inferr our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would have forbidden Children being Baptized, had it been his Deſign not to have had them admitted thereunto; than that he would have enjoyned that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if it had been his Deſign (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it was) the Cuſtom thereof ſhould be uſed, and allowed under his New Diſpenſation; For there was no neceſſity to enjoyn his Diſciples to obſerve what with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Command they would practiſe, unleſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101430:55"/>he had forbad them; and that he did not forbid them the uſe of this Holy Ordinance, is plain, in that he did not forbid Children being Baptized: For if he forbad Children that Holy Ordinance, he either did it by a direct Injunction, or by Conſequence, by confining the uſe of that Holy Ordinance only to Adult perſons; That he never did debarr them by a direct Injunction, all <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> of ſence allow, becauſe we read it not in his Sacred Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But they ſay it was his Purpoſe, that thoſe alone that were Adult were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereunto, becauſe antecedent to Baptiſm Men were to be inſtructed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to repent; which they ſeem to prove from this Text of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviij. 19. and St. <hi>Mark</hi> xvj. 15. and <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 38. Now they alledge theſe are only ſuited to thoſe that are Adult; and therefore they only ſhould be admitted to Baptiſm. Theſe are the Texts by which the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> would evidence that Chriſt did ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine that Holy Ordinance as to debarr Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren its uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I Anſwer, They herein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly err, for theſe Places do no more evince or prove, that only thoſe that are Adults ſhould be Baptized, than what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iij. 10. will inferr that the Adult only ſhould eat: <hi>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any man would not work, neither ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101430:56"/>he eat.</hi> On which account, in a fallacious manner, this Argument might be drawn; becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Thoſe that eat <hi>muſt</hi> work, but now the Adult only <hi>can</hi> work; therefore they only <hi>muſt</hi> eat, whereby we ſhould ſtarve Children, and infirm People, that cannot work, and Aged perſons that are paſt it. I have given this Example to ſignifie how impertinent the Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Baptizing Children are; and that it can never be evinced, or made out, from any place of Holy Scripture, that That Ordinance is limited only to the Adult, becauſe ſuch only can be inſtructed, can believe, and can repent. The falſeneſs of this way of arguing will appear from an eaſie Similitude, (that, as I remember I have read in the Learned <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Tract of <hi>Inſant-Baptiſm,</hi>) which the weakeſt Man may apprehend. <q>Imagine there was a mortal and infectious Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a populous City, and Heaven ſhould appoint a ſett number of perſons to acquaint them with an Infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that ſhould cure this Diſtemper, and it ſhould be declared to them; Travel to ſuch a City, and aſſemble the Inhabitants, and acquaint them with the good this Remedy will do; and aſcertain them, That whoſoever hath Faith to receive it from you, for that purpoſe ſhall recover; but he that doubts the truth of what you ſay, ſhall periſh.</q> Upon this allowance,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101430:56"/>which is reaſonable to allow) I ask any <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> if the terms of ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were enough for thoſe that had it; or any elſe to inferr, That it was the Deſign of Heaven that they ought to communicate this Remedy only to the Adult, becauſe only ſuch could be aſſembled to know its Worth, have Faith in its Efficacy, or doubt of its Power? Surely ſuch a concluſion would not be allowed, becauſe Infants would be as fit to receive the Remedy as the Adult, though they did not at all know the Advantages thereof. Now then, becauſe Infants were fit to receive the Advantage of that Holy Ordinance, and the Diſciples to whom the Order was imparted ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and were not unacquainted with its Uſage under the Old Law; how was it poſſible to ſuppoſe, but that it was the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s deſign, that Children ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptiſm as well as thoſe that were Adult. That which was really true, is this: Their Order was an Inſtruction how they ſhould Diſciple the Enemies to the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus, Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> to his Holy Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, according to the manner of Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a New Diſpenſation in Foreign Parts. Hereupon they were Commiſſionated to Proſelyte grown Perſons by Preaching to, and Baptizing ſuch as ſhould thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent; but notwithſtanding that according to Order they ſhould do ſo, as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to do with thoſe that they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101430:57"/>Proſelyted to their Religion; and this was no barr to their admitting the Children of ſuch Proſelytes according to their known Cuſtom.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer.

Thus much I have ſaid to make appear how impertinent and unconcluding the Arguments of our Adverſaries from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture are, to deny Children a right of being Baptized; becauſe all the places I have mentioned, or they inſiſt upon, do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie

And now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given you the true ſence of this Text, and a large Expoſition to confirm it, let me make this one Obſervation: Our dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the Tranſlation of his Church from the Law to the Holy Goſpel, did not annul or revoke the old Cuſtom of Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Children, but he deſigned the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it as large as under the Law, otherwiſe he would not have been ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and extenſive a Saviour, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Legiſlator; and ſo conſequently had not been ſo faithfull in his Houſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, which he certainly was, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> plainly inſinuates, <hi>Chap.</hi> iij. 5, 6. If therefore it be ſo, (as undoubtedly it is,)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101430:58"/>then it will follow, There is as great an engagement upon Fathers and Tutors (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Church's Authority) to bring their Infants to be Baptized, as for thoſe that are Adult, and full-grown, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for it. Now ſeeing Chriſt did not revoke the Old former Cuſtom, it is an evident Declaration to the World, That it was his Will it ſhould remain as it was, and had been formerly uſed; and that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children were admitted into Covenant, under the Law, by a Sacramental Sign, they ſhould be admitted unto Covenant under the Holy Goſpel by a Sacramental Rite like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. It was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> before our Bleſſed Saviour's Advent, or Coming; and the Cuſtom of his Followers within a while after his Illuſtrious Aſcenſion unto the Manſions of Glory. And there being an agreeable Harmony between the former and the latter Cuſtom, we may reaſonably believe, that what was Antecedent to, and Conſequent upon, his Advent, or Coming, was uſed in the Interval; I mean in the Holy Apoſtolic Age, as his ſuppoſed deſign and deſire, who never declared or acted any matter (that can with tolerable Reaſon be urged) againſt the Old Uſage of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Members into Eccleſiaſtic Society. So that his and the Holy Goſpel's not ſaying any thing whether Children were Baptized or no, is ſo far from being a cogent Proof againſt it, that weighing the former Cuſtom, it is the ſtrongeſt Motive to believe it, as the

               <q>For when Infant-Baptiſm, in the Jewiſh Church, in admitting Proſelytes, was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101430:59"/>known, uſual and frequent, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more known, uſual and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, there was no need of a particular Precept to ſtrengthen it; For Chriſt took and tranſlated it into his Holy Goſpel, as he found it, only with this addition, That he employed it to a larger uſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted it to a more noble End; For the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> knew very well that little ones were wont to be Baptized, ſo that there was no need of a Precept to eſtabliſh that which was grown into uſe by common Cuſtom. If a Royal Edict ſhould be publiſhed in theſe words, <hi>Let every one repair on the Lord's Day to the Public Aſſemblies in the Church:</hi> Certainly that Man would be diſtracted that ſhould argue, Prayers were not to be offered in the Public Aſſemblies on the Lord's Day, nor Sermons preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor Pſalms ſung, becauſe there was no mention of them in the Edict, when antecedent to the publiſhing the Edict theſe things were known to be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe and cuſtom. It is the very ſame thing with Baptiſm, when Chriſt made it an Evangelic Sacrament, whereby all ſhould be admitted to the Profeſſion and Privileges of his Holy Goſpel, as formerly Proſelytes were to the Jewiſh Religion. There was no need of Rule, or defining the particular manner of Baptizing, as what Age ſhould be Baptized, or what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101430:59"/>Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe theſe things were by common uſage known to the weakeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: So that there was a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for an expreſs and open Prohibition that Infants and little ones ſhould not be Baptized, if our Bleſſed Saviour would not have them ſo to be admitted into his Covenant. If then Chriſt would have had that Cuſtom aboliſhed, he ſhould have openly prohibited it; His and the Holy Scripture's ſilence therefore doth for ever confirm and maintain the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants.</q> So that if Baptizing Children be not only needfull, becauſe the Church hath inſtituted it; but the Church hath inſtituted it, becauſe it is needfull, and by all means to be continued; then this preceding Needfulneſs is the greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to Fathers and Guardians to bring them thereunto, as correſpondent to the Cuſtom of the firſt Planters of the Bleſſed Goſpel, and the deſign and deſire of our mercifull Redeemer; becauſe it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be believed it had their Allowance, or Command, being it was uſed in the times immediately ſucceeding to the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and alſo, if it had been diſagreeable to the Mind of Chriſt, it is very probable he would have forbid it, or ſome way or other declared his Averſion, or Diſlike. In ſhort, to conclude the Expoſition of the Sence I have delivered of this Text: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more diſparage the Wiſdom of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101430:60"/>Heaven, and the long-approved Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than to affirm Children unfit by Sacramental Seal to be admitted to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant under the Holy Goſpel, that were admitted under the Law, and which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the <hi>Jews</hi> allowed them; For Heaven enjoyned Circumciſion for Infants, and the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyned them Baptiſm as well as full-grown Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; and under the Law they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed both. It is highly unreaſonable then, that under the Holy Goſpel they ſhould be denied one, or any other Token of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Covenant, as they muſt neceſſarily be by <hi>Antipaedobaptiſtic</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> And now give me leave to offer ſomething further to an Objection of the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> in reference to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Their Objection (as I have already hinted) is from the Order of Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Teaching is ſet before Baptizing; Therefore none but the full grown can be admitted to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now all that I ſhall ſay, or need to ſay, in return to the placing of the Words, is this: Teaching, according to the ſence we have given, may go before Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as in the Adult; and Baptizing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Teaching, as in Infants: So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out altering the Order of the Words, there is nothing in the true ſence of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that condemns the Baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101430:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>and I may ſay of Teaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, or Baptizing and Teaching, as it may be ſaid of Faith and Repentance: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do generally ſay, <hi>Repentance is the fruit of Faith;</hi> and yet in the Holy Goſpel it is ſaid, <hi>Repent ye, and believe the Goſpel,</hi> St. Mark i. 15. And now what I have ſaid of the Order of Teaching and Baptizing, the ſame may be ſaid of Faith and Repentance; There may be a Faith that may go before Repentance, and a Faith that may follow it; That which precedes, may be ſaid to be that Faith that fills the Head, and informs the Judgment; That Faith which may be ſaid to be ſubſequent, is the Faith that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences the Heart, and ſaves the Soul; The one may be called a <hi>ſound</hi> Faith, the other a <hi>ſaving</hi> Faith. My meaning, in ſhort, is this: I muſt firſt believe the great Love of Chriſt, which is a ſound Faith, or elſe I cannot ſo truly grieve for thoſe Sins that pierced the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s ſide, and put him to death; and ſo Faith precedes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But then I cannot exerciſe the other ſort or kind of Faith, untill I really deteſt, and hate, and fully purpoſe to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh and forſake thoſe Sins that put my dear Lord and Maſter to ſo much ſhame and pain; and then I may ſafely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably make an Application of Chriſt's Merits to my ſelf for my Salvation: And this is that which is properly called a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith; and this is that which may be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101430:62"/>ſaid to be conſequent upon, and follow true Repentance. And this I do think may ſufficiently ſatisfie us, that the ordering or placing the words deſtroys not, nor eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuates the ſence I have given of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And now ſeeing the <hi>Antipaedóbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> are ſo peremptory, poſitive and ſtiff for an expreſs Command out of Holy Scripture for the Baptizing of Infants, (though there can be no Reaſon given for ſuch a requeſt or demand; for what need of direct words, when we have plain ſence againſt them,) Why may not we with equal Reaſon, and with the ſame Importunity, return upon them by way of Retortion, and ask where they find any Command for the Baptizing Elder perſons? If they ſhall reply, that is included in the Commiſſion, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviij. 19. <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> we may with equal ſtrength of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument return upon them again, Children are included as well as the Adult, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all Men of Sence acknowledged and owned to be a part of the Nations, to whom the Commiſſion is directed; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are upon the account of the ſmallneſs of their Number, or weakneſs of their Underſtanding, they are a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of a Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But if the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that Children are in the Commiſſion, as ſoon as capable of Teaching.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer: The Commiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends thoſe ſhould be taught that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but excludes not thoſe from the Seal of the Covenant, that have a right to the Covenant, as Children have: Beſides, if the placing of the Words be for them in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the Order of Words is for us in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> where we read the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did Baptize before he Preached. So that the Methodizing the words is neither for, nor againſt them or us. So then, ſeeing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not by any neceſſary and rational Conſequence ſhut out of the Commiſſion, let the moſt Learned <hi>Antipaedobaptiſt</hi> of the whole Chriſtian World ſhew the leaſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Holy Scripture that excludes them; and if they cannot produce any ſuch place of Holy Writ, they are bound by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations and Principles of Conſcience (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will renounce Reaſon and Truth too) to confeſs the Children of Chriſtian Parents, having a right to the Covenant, have as undeniable and unqueſtionable a right of being admitted to the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm as the Adult and Full-grown.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I Anſwer, That an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or Inſtance of Holy Scripture, is not as of the ſame Force, ſo not of equal
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101430:63"/>Authority with a Poſitive Command: And further, I obſerve in anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That there was no need of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or Example, for the Baptizing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and my Reaſon is this, Becauſe there was an Inſtitution of the <hi>Abrahamic</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and alſo of the Sign or Token for admitting Members thereunto, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Privileges thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. Surely the ſence of thoſe Texts in the Holy Goſpel, that enjoyn a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Faith, and an Exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before the Adult were baptized, was known to the Primitive Doctors of the Church, they unqueſtionably had ſeriouſly weighed, and fully underſtood the Uſage of Baptiſm in the Apoſtolic Acts related by St. <hi>Luke;</hi> but yet they never inferred this unreaſonable Concluſion from them, That becauſe Faith and Repentance were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Baptiſmal Sacrament (which is an Inſtitution of Latitude) in full-grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that therefore Baptizing was not to precede Faith and Repentance in Infants, and little ones, as Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm did under the Jewiſh Diſpenſation: They underſtood a Diſtinction between Actual and Potential Believers; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe underſtood it was very abſurd to draw Concluſions from the Graces and Vertues of thoſe to the excluding theſe. Beſides all this, to be ſomewhat more particular:</p>
            <p n="(1.)">

There are different ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as different methods of Faith or Believing; and the Holy <hi>Jeſus</hi> doth not declare, inſtruct each Party perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and that preſently on the place, (which may be almoſt Morally impoſſible, for it is not probable that though there were Three thouſand Souls converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Sermon, and immediately baptized, that he could perſonally inſtruct ſo many in ſo ſhort a time, as we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between his Preaching and their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing;) it is enough if they be inſtructed, though in their Fathers, as <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tythe in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> acquaints us, <hi>Hebr.</hi> vij. 9.

And that I may ſpeak fully hereto, I will give, (1.) A General; and, (2.) A Particular Account.

               <note place="margin">An <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> That is true, ſaith the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſt,</hi> As many as the Lord our God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101430:65"/>ſhall call by the public Miniſtry of his holy Word; ſo that they would inſinuate, that Children are not to be admitted into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Sign thereof, till convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But hereto I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">anſw. </seg>
               </label> This is plainly falſe, becauſe the word [Many] cannot refer to Children, ſeeing it ſhould have been <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. So that the ſenſe is plainly this, The Promiſe is to you and to your Children, <hi>i. e.</hi> after you have forſaken the beggerly Elements of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced my holy Religion, my more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſpenſation, your Children (while Children) ſhall (after ſuch a public Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your Faith in me, and my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Doctrin) be made capable of being Members of my Covenant of Grace; and by the Sign and Seal of my Covenant, Baptiſm be admitted and received into the ſame, and to all that are afar off (a uſual Phraſe in holy Scripture, to expreſs and ſignify the Heathen Nations by) as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, <hi>i. e.</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Gentile World as ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the public Miniſtry of the holy Word, ſhall have the ſame Priviledges which the Proſelites of Righteouſneſs or Juſtice had, in your Church; <hi>i. e.</hi> after ſuch a Converſion and public Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, your Children like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall be received into my Covenant of

For what the Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts would make the meaning of this Text is true in one ſenſe, tho' not to their purpoſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> That Children cannot be called or converted to the Chriſtian Faith (becauſe of their natural Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) by the public Preaching of the holy Goſpel; and therefore it could not be <gap reason="foreign">

So that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle, St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Promiſe to thoſe of years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Pagan World, that ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian Faith, upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction they received in their minds from the public Miniſtry of the holy Apoſtles. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> uſes a word of the Maſculine Gender, becauſe that agrees with a Greek word of the ſame Gender, that ſignifies Men (I mean <gap reason="foreign">

If you of the Jewiſh Nation will embrace the Chriſtian Religion, and own and ſubmit to the Faith of the Holy Jeſus, the Benefits, Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges of the New Covenant of Grace, are by us Apoſtles promiſed to, and ſhall by the power of the holy Ghoſt (the Gift of which for the uſe of the Church is communicated to us) be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made over, conferred and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you and your Children; and the ſame Promiſe St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101430:67"/>Nation; and their Children he alſo makes to the Heathen World, and their Offspring, which enlarges the ſenſe I have given: And that this muſt be the ſenſe, may appear from the Original Word uſed for Promiſe [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which is of a like ſound, and of the ſame derivation, and of a near ſignification with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is the Greek word for the holy Goſpel; which is as it were the counterpart of the new Covenant, or the Covenant of Grace, that contains all the Parts and Articles thereof. So that by virtue of your Faith, the Title and Bleſſings of the Covenant ſhall be imputed to your Children, that thereby they may be made as capable of Baptiſm (the Sign of Admiſſion into the Chriſtian Church) under the holy Goſpel, as your Children are now by vertue of your Jewiſh Faith capable of Circumciſion (the Seal that gave a Title to the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Law) and if you will not allow the words this ſenſe, what St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpake muſt rather confirm and harden the Jews in their own way, and their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic</hi> obſervations then perſuade, and bring them over to Chriſtianity; and upon this undeniable ſenſe of the former part of the Text, the latter muſt be allowed the ſame Expoſition; becauſe any other Senſe and Interpretation will be an impediment, bar and hindrance to the Progreſs of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. So that if we have any love
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101430:67"/>for the bleſſed Jeſus, and deſire exactly to obſerve his divine Inſtitutions, this Phraſe <hi>[And to all that are afar off]</hi> muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and interpreted from unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable parity of Reaſon; according to the ſenſe we have already given of the former part of the Text <hi>[The Promiſe is to you and to your Children]</hi> which anſwers the true meaning of our bleſſed Saviour's Commiſſion to the holy Apoſtles, according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have offered, and may be called a Logical Demonſtration; as convictive to Reaſon, as a Mathematic Demonſtration is to the Senſes of Mankind.</p>

            <p>BUT Secondly, I will give you a more particular Account, that I may offer all that is neceſſary to be ſaid upon this Text: And here that I may deal fairly with our Adverſaries, I will give them two Conceſſions, which I think is all they can reaſonably ask. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(1.) We will allow that St. <hi>Peter</hi> deſigned to ſupport their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as to their Infants, upon their outcry (when the <hi>Roman</hi> Preſident declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:101430:68"/>innocent of the Blood of that juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<note place="margin">St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxvij. 25.</note> upon which they exclaimed) <hi>His Blood be upon us, and upon our Children.</hi> (2.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We will allow, that it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that by Children, here, may be underſtood adult Perſons, yet in the words are ſeveral particulars ſo clear as will be ſtrong enough to defend our Orthodox Principle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(1.) That the Promiſe here offered to them and their Children, was the New Diſpenſation the Holy Jeſus was Author of, and the ſame Diſpenſation, which (tho' in obſcurer terms and times) had been declared to the Father of the Faithful, which Diſpenſation alſo included Father and Son. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>(2.) That except St. <hi>Peter</hi> did in this Promiſe include their Children, they had not been ſtrongly ſupported under the Curſe they wiſhed for <hi>themſelves</hi> and their <hi>Offspring,</hi> upon ſuppoſition they ſhould depart this World before <hi>actual Repentance.</hi> (3.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They had no reaſon to believe their Infants included in the Promiſe, except they had been qualified for the Sign and Sacrament under the New Diſpenſation, as they were of the Sign of the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for all viſible Confirmation is by Seal, and by this account we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the full ſenſe of what is ſaid, <hi>Ver.</hi> 41. <hi>And the ſame day were added to them about three thouſand Souls,</hi> viz. Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, becoming Chriſtians, Infants, and all in their Houſe, according to the Terms of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101430:68"/>the Covenant and Uſage of the Jews, were admitted and received to Baptiſm, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how ſhould three thouſand Souls be particularly taught; for it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon did reach the ears of all that were there preſent; and moreover, (as our Adverſaries would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us) they muſt every one be treated with, and ſpoken to, which was morally impoſſible for ſo few Apoſtles, as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be conjectured to be there, and in ſo ſhort a time, as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe they ſtayed where they were. But to all this our Adverſaries gainſay, becauſe the Text tells us not,
<note place="margin">An <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> they and their Children were receiv'd to Baptiſm, but they only, that gladly receiv'd his Word.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note> To which I make this return: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(1.) This Text doth not ſo evidently conclude the thing done, that Children were then receiv'd to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (tho' it may properly enough infer it from what hath been offered in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Account) as their Title to it by force of their being adopted into Covenant by virtue of their Parents Faith. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>(2.) That the Infants were receiv'd to Baptiſm, is not ſpecified, becauſet here was no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for doing that which might be reaſonably ſuppoſed. (3.) Becauſe the Covenant, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for ſubſtance, was the ſame with that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to <hi>Abraham</hi> of old time, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration made the ſole diſtinction. (4.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There being three thouſand Souls ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101430:69"/>to the Church, they could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Members thereof without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and this being all done in one day, it is not in the leaſt probable they could all be adult Men; or if they were, it is as highly improbable, ſo few as the Holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles then were, could have time (which our Adverſaries think neceſſary) to treat with, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and diſcourſe every perſon. (5.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all is not expreſſed in Holy Writ that was tranfacted; and when an Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is rehearſed, ſome Particulars are inſerted not named in the prior, or former Declaration. As for inſtance, In the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Holy Apoſtle of the Gentiles, his miraculous Call is taken notice of three times, and his being baptized more than once; and yet in the ſecond Relation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Baptiſm, there is ſomething ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the firſt Account, <hi>Acts</hi> xxij. 16. <hi>Ariſe, and be baptized, and waſh away they ſins, calling on the Name of the Lord,</hi> declaring the Scope and Deſign of Baptiſm, as well as how neceſſary it was; and it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble had there been reaſon to rehearſe this Account related <hi>Acts</hi> ij. as there was of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s other matters, poſſibly this of admitting Infants to Baptiſm had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>(6.) By way of Retortion, to return their own Argument upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Women are not named neither in the Commiſſion, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviij. 19. nor <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 41. to be baptized, both being
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101430:69"/>rendred by the Greek in the Maſculine Gender; I may therefore, according to their way of arguing, urge, becauſe it is not declared in the Sacred Text, that they who gladly received the Word with their Wives were baptized, I might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to their manner of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſay, no Women had as yet received Baptiſm; for it was after this time, that we read in <hi>Samaria,</hi> Women were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by St. <hi>Philip.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            <head>CHAP. X. <hi>The Senſe of St.</hi> Matth. xxviij. 19. <hi>ſtrengthned by an Expoſition of</hi> 1 Cor. vij. 14.</head>
            <p>THE ſecond place is that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Holy Apoſtle of the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion or the Gentile World, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> vij. 14. <hi>For the unbelieving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the husband, elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</hi> This place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is a ſtrong confirmation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101430:70"/>of the Senſe, and a clear conviction of the truth of the Interpretation I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the firſt Text of the laſt quoted place of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, (the moſt learned and ſtricteſt Sect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews) and was ſo well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Chriſtian Religion, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, he was not a whit behind any (the beſt, and moſt knowing) of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtles, and for the encouragement of the Pagan World to embrace Chriſtianity, he publickly declares, and aſſures them, that the believing Paganiſh Husband, or Wiſe, ſhould have a Power and Priviledge to tranſmit and convey their Faith to their Seed; ſo that their Children, after ſuch a converſion of the Parent, ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a Federal, or Covenant-Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſhould be of ſuch efficacy and vertue, as to impute and make over to them a Right to the Covenant, and then, by the Seal of Baptiſm, to be receiv'd into the Church, admitted to the favour of God, and made Heirs of Heaven by virtue of their Memberſhip in the Covenant of Grace. Thus we plainly ſee, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Holy Scripture, and by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon, (a Reaſon ſo infallible and unerring, that it is conducted by the Light of Divine Revelation) what is the plain, natural, and proper ſenſe of the Holy Jeſus's Commiſſion to his Bleſſed Diſciples, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviij. 9. <hi>Go teach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101430:70"/>all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> So that he who ſhall from a miſtaken ſenſe of that place of Holy Scripture, deny Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm unto Infants, hinders the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Progreſs of Chriſtian Religion, makes the Covenant of Grace leſs benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and extenſive than the Covenant of Works; and ſo conſequently doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as great Benefits, Priviledges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities to the Covenant of Grace which he doth to the Covenant of Works, all which are the dangerous Conſequences of Antipedobaptiſm, as I hope I have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved, and convincingly made out; and in the evincing, or proving this Argument, I have plainly ſhewed, that we have the proper meaning of three Texts of Holy Scripture, which I think to any Man of ſenſe is as clear a Proof, and as powerful an Evidence to engage our belief to the truth of any Doctrin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to us, as if we had brought the poſitive and expreſs Words of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is as ſtrong a conviction as any Man can with the leaſt ſhew of reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. So that if the true ſenſe of the Holy Jeſus's Commiſſion to his Bleſſed Diſciples be duly conſidered, and that no other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can tolerably be put upon them, being backt with the Authority of two other places of Holy Scripture, (and a threefold Cord is not eaſily broken) no Antipedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, that is a Man of ſenſe, will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101430:71"/>preſs for a poſitive and direct place of Holy Writ, becauſe he hath no reaſon to expect a Tautology in Sacred Scripture, to pleaſe an Humour, or ſerve an Intereſt, and becauſe he will thereby weaken his Cauſe, and then have great reaſon to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of, if not repent for the Injury he doth his Principles, and he will ſee the vanity of demanding expreſs words for a confutation, when he hath plain ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for the Holy Scriptures are to be expounded and interpreted by their Senſe, and not by their Sound; by their Spiritual Meaning, and not by the bare Words, Syllables, and Letters; for they are beſt underſtood by their proper Deſign and Purport, or a true Relation to their Coherence and Connexion with what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, and follows after. And now give me leave to offer one thing that will confirm the ſenſe of the Texts I have delivered, and will alſo further ſhew how unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and abſurd, weak, and trifling, the Antipedobaptiſts are, for being ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory and poſitive in demanding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs place of Holy Scripture for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Infants, and this I will endeavour to evince from Cuſtoms among the Jews, well known to all learned Men. Three things were required by the Jews to make a Male Proſelyte of Righteouſneſs, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, a kind of Purfication by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which was an Alluſion to Baptiſm)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101430:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Oblation, which was commonly two Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or Pidgeons; To a Female Purification by Water, and Oblation. Now becauſe the Jews, ſince their Diſperſion, have neither Altar nor Sacrifice, they ſay, For the Male, Circumciſion, and Purification by Water, are ſufficient: For the Female, Only Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Water. In <hi>David</hi>'s time, they tell us many Thouſands were added to the Church without Circumciſion, by Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only. Hence we may obſerve, that a kind of Admiſſion by Water into the Church, was long in uſe among the Jews, tho' it were not Sacramental till the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus's Inſtitution, therefore it may ſeem to be uſed by them, becauſe they looked for it as a Sacrament at the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Meſſiah, as is evident by their coming to St. <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> not ſo much ſcrupling his Baptiſm, as his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by what Power he baptized: St. <hi>John</hi> i. 25. <hi>And they asked him, and ſaid unto him, Why baptizeſt thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, nor that Prophet?</hi> By which three different words they meant the Meſſiah, becauſe he was well known to the Jews by thoſe Terms or Phraſes to be foreſignified; ſo that had he owned himſelf for ſuch, they would not have doubted his Commiſſion; but Chriſt being plainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Meſſiah, he was Lord of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as well as of the Sabbath, and ſo had a ſufficient Power to inſtitute a New
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101430:72"/>Sacrament, and ſo ſubſtituted Baptiſm in the room of Circumciſion, which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes not to be as extenſive as the other, is ſo irrational as to make the holy Jeſus not ſo merciful a Legiſlator as <hi>Moſes;</hi> which ſhews the unreaſonableneſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of demanding an expreſs Text of holy Scripture for Infant Baptiſm, which was the Truth to be cleared; and I hope is ſufficiently made apparent and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101430:72"/>Children who are baptized believe, yet I judge the Teſtimonies from Holy Scripture above-named, moſt ſtrong Evidences, and a ſufficient Proof for this Chriſtian Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; neither ought Chriſtians to depart from this Truth, tho' I cannot underſtand or explain how Children believe. In ſome things we ſhould take St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, <hi>And become Fools that we may be wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. iij. 18. <hi>Obedience being more acceptable than burnt Offerings,</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 22. And we ſhould offer up our Underſtandings to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, where there is clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſubmit to it.

But prais'd be Heaven, I have yet met with no Arguments of the Adverſaries ſo ſtrong, as to need ſuch an Apology or Plea. We find not any Accuſation laid to the Charge of Chriſtianity, by the Jewiſh or Pagan World upon this Account, which certainly would have been done by ſome of the Enemies of our holy Religion, if the Jewiſh Believer had not enjoyed the ſame Immunities, when Chriſtian, that he did before: Or if the firſt Planters of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity had preached the ſame Doctrin the Antipedobaptiſts do now, how would the

I am not obliged to make any return. (2.) This is a perillous Method of arguing to Religion. (3.) That it doth not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Cauſe. (1.) I am not obliged to make any return: For we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Cuſtom, ſeeing we have ſo ſtrong Reaſons from holy Writ for it; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have ſo long enjoyed and uſed it, by ſo many Inſtances from the Primitive times (as may be proved;) ſo that we have Preſcription to plead, and that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers tells us, in ſome Caſes, is a good Bar againſt all other Titles. It is upon theſe Accounts your duty, that contradict it, to declare any one Inſtance or Proof, that theſe Reaſons, and this continued Cuſtom of all times ſince the holy Apoſtolick Age, ſhould not be continued; which I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied they will not be able to perform, if
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101430:73"/>they ſhould be ſo couragious as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and therefore it will be in vain to make any attempt that way. (2.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This method of demanding poſitive Words from Holy Writ for all that Men are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or do, is extream hazardous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, where there is ſufficient reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an Authority to engage our Faith. (1.) As to Doctrin, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it would cenſure the Method of arguing uſed by our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Holy Diſciples, and ſo make way for a falling from the Truth, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entrance to the moſt pernicious Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; and therefore he that believes ſuch a Doctrin can be no good Chriſtian: and poſſibly for this Reaſon ſeveral have gone from one Sect to another, till they came to be of no Religion at all, and looking for what is not to be had in Holy Writ, nor ſhould be expected from any ſort of arguing, they have thereupon caſt off all. (2.) As to cuſtomary Practices, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what a door of entrance would there be for ſtrange Doctrins, and ſtranger Practices? there is no Command for, or Inſtance of a Woman partaking in the Holy Communion; we read not of the baptizing of the Holy Diſciples; no Command or Inſtance of one that is not a Clergyman may not have more Wives than one, whereupon I have read of one in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that married more than one at a time, and as it was ſuppoſed for that Reaſon. (3.) It doth not further their Cauſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe where there is a good Reaſon for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101430:74"/>or do, we are not to ſtop or ſtay our belief, or defer acting, till we have an Inſtance from Holy Scripture: What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or foreknown Inſtance had the Holy Apoſtle of the Circumciſion to admit the Centurion of the Italian Band and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to Baptiſm, ſeeing they were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, only that he collected it, that becauſe he had a Title to the Covenant, (by the miraculous Gift of the Holy Ghoſt) he had right to the Sign that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the Priviledge of the Covenant. The Commiſſion the Holy Jeſus gave to his Bleſſed Diſciples at his leaving the World, in relation to the perſons, is in the Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Gender, and the Account of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s baptizing his firſt Converts was in the ſame Gender; Why then did St. <hi>Philip</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to baptiſm, Women as well as Men, <hi>Acts</hi> viij. 12? And why do the Antipedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, as well as we, admit Women to the Communion, when there is neither Command nor Rule to enjoyn it? To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all, I ſhall need to ſay by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon theſe three Texts, As the Obligatory Power of the Ceremonies and Rites among the Jews was aboliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not agree with the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper of the Chriſtian Inſtitution; ſo more principally was it taken away, as being diſagreeable to the Notion of its being an Univerſal Society, for it would have impeded the Propagation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the B. Jeſus, had it been burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101430:74"/>with the Ceremonies and Rites of the Jews, which were grown hateful, as well as nauſeous to the Heatheniſh part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and, to name no other Inſtance, he was upon this account engaged to alter the Sacrament for Admiſſion into his Church, or the Sign of the Old Covenant Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, I mean, whereby the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (excepting ſome few Nations, as the ancient <hi>Egyptians, Ethiopians, Iſhmaclites,</hi> and <hi>Colchians</hi>) were differenced from the reſt of Mankind: They were, I ſay,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>pag.</hi> 20.</note> grown nauſeous and hateful to the World for the uſe thereof; as it is inſinuated by ſeveral of the Poets, as <hi>Martial, Horace, Petroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Juvenal.

And upn this account it would have been a great hindrance to the propagation of the New Diſpenſation, ſhould the Heathen World have been admitted to the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by that way; no Sacred Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could be more unacceptable to Mankind in general; and hereupon the Wiſdom of our. Merciful Redeemer, as well as New Legiſlator, is to be commended in alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old antiquated Sign into a more gentle, pleaſant way of admiſſion by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was as of a more univerſal uſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101430:75"/>ſo of a more general ſignification, becauſe the Heathen World, as well as the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> uſed it, (For Heatheniſm was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe but the Jewiſh Religion abuſed by the Prince of Darkneſs, and Father of Lies, as Chriſtianity was little more than pure Natural Reaſon exalted, and improved by the King of Light and Purity.)</p>

But I will give one remarkable Example, and ſo conclude this way of confirming the Senſe and Expoſitions I have given and the Senſe of what I ſhall ſay, (for his words I cannot give you, it being ſo long ſince I read him) I ſhall borrow from the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> a Man of the greateſt knowledge in underſtanding the Cuſtom of the Jews and Rabbinic Learning; The Text is St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xvij. 20. <hi>If you have faith, as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, you ſhall ſay unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto you.</hi> Now this is naturally impoſſible in a literal ſenſe, but to ſuch as are acquainted with a cuſtomary Saying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, this ſeemingly difficult place hath an eaſie and intelligible mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it was an uſual Saying among them, of a learned Rabbi, (that had a skilful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the expounding hard places of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101430:76"/>Scripture) <hi>That he was a Man of ſuch Learning, he could remove Mountains.</hi> Now this Phraſe the H.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101430:76"/>that I may the better engage your belief to the ſenſe I have given of theſe three Texts, I have interpreted them according to Jewiſh Cuſtoms and Phraſes. As to the firſt,

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101430:79"/>of Infants unto Covenant under the H. Goſpel Diſpenſation, when they had been ever allowed it under the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Oeconomy? Is it not rational to imagine, that they who made ſo great Complaints, only becauſe the H. Diſciples inſtructed the Jewiſh People that dwelt in Heathen Countries, that they were not bound to uſe Circumciſion, would not have made greater Complaints if they had not admitted them and their Children unto Baptiſm, but wholly ſhut them out, like the Children of Infidels, and not allowed them to be Members of Chriſt's Myſtical Body? It certainly, in all likelihood, would have been a ſore Grief to them, to obſerve their Infants uſed as bad as the Infants of Pagans and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, and to have no clear diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch Children, whoſe Parents received the H.

But now had the H. Diſciples publicly preached that the Infants of ſuch as were admitted into Covenant with God, had no other Title to an admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm, than the Infants of Pagans, who were not in Covenant; they had preached a Doctrin, which would aſſuredly have been a higher Scandal than whatever they had preached againſt the neceſſity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing Males, and the obſervation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law of Ceremonies: Whereupon ſince
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101430:80"/>we do not find among their grievous Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the change of the Jewiſh Uſages, that they murmured or repined that their Infants were not baptized, and ſo made capable of the Benefits of the new Covenant of Grace; It is a much more probable Reaſon to believe, that the firſt Planters of Chriſtianity and their Aſſociates, admitted Infants to Baptiſm, than the not ſhewing a plain Example or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Precept for it under the H.

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:101430:83"/>Grandmothers. If we were to Preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfect Infidels the ſame that Chriſt commiſſionated his holy Diſciples to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, thoſe that were adult before they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Chriſtianity, we muſt firſt inſtruct them, and then Diſciple them; which word in the Original the Antipedobaptiſts are very fond of; and yet I ſuppoſe, with due ſubmiſſion, I have made clear proof, that the true ſenſe of it doth not in the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or ſtrengthen their Principle: The phraſe Diſcipling is the principal word in the Commiſſion, and Baptizing and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the formal modification of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; tho if the words were otherwiſe placed, and Inſtruction in expreſs words had preceeded Baptiſm, their turn would not have been ſerved thereby; for the Commiſſion naming no Sex or Quality, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Age, nor on any other account, muſt neceſſarily take in whatſoever parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars can be comprehended under that Phraſe; and the Antipedobaptiſts cannot poſſibly make a difference from the words themſelves. Hereupon it is clearly evident, that if the bleſſed Jeſus intended all Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, when he uſed the Phraſe, <hi>all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> then it is all one as if he had declared all Capacities of Reaſonable Beings, both as to Sex and Age, ſhould be admitted unto Baptiſm, the ſign of admiſſion into his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpel Covenant. Now that this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commiſſion takes in each ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101430:83"/>of Reaſonable Beings, we will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from three things, (even the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Circumſtances neceſſary to any Human Action) the Place where, the Time when, and the Parties concerned in the Action. (1.) The Place where: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This Commiſſion was not delivered out in any Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> where it is acknowledged by all Parties, that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of admitting all ſorts of Gentiles, that embraced the Jewiſh Religion unto Baptiſm was conſtantly practiſed. (2.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Commiſſion was delivered when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were moſt ſtrict and exact in the obſervation of their ancient Rites and Uſages. (3.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This Commiſſion was given out by our Meſſiah, born in <hi>Judea,</hi> to his immediate Followers and Attendants, his dear Friends, that were Natives of the ſame Country, and thereupon it is not in the leaſt improbable, but that they well knew the conſtant and general Uſages then tranſacted by the Jews. Now upon theſe Accounts it is evident, that Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for Diſcipling all Nations was as genuine and clear, as if he had deſcended unto Particulars. For he that gave the Commiſſion, and they unto whom it was granted, fully underſtood what Perſons were capable of the Ordinance of Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into his Holy Church; and hereupon an Univerſal Uſage and an Univerſal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were moſt proportionable and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101430:84"/>correſpondent to the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power of our Great Legiſlator. It was a conſtant and uninterrupted Uſage with the Jewiſh People to admit unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm whole Houſholds (wherein we may reaſonably ſuppoſe Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren contained) of Gentile Proſelites; ſo that it being the uſage to leave none un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, there was no neceſſity for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Order, or mentioning who ſhould be baptized; ſo that if there were need of exempting any, we may well imagine the Holy Jeſus would have excluded them; but we read of no ſuch Exception in Holy Scripture: So that the Queſtion ought to be thus ſtated, Whether Infants are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited Baptiſm, and in what Place, or at what Time? We appeal to all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, if this be the ſenſe, as is moſt probable, whether the Commiſſion is in the leaſt obſcure, or more obſcurely pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for Infants, than for thoſe that are adult, can be no Exception, becauſe no particulars are named. Three Thouſand Converts are baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.

All the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons acknowledged a Meſſiah, but moſt of them abominated that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould be thought to be he; therefore thoſe that by the preaching of the Holy Goſpel came to acknowledge him to be the Meſſiah were baptized in his Name, as the Critical Badge, (the <gap reason="foreign">

The Community of Goods may be conſidered under theſe two Animadverſions, (which, becauſe it may be uſeful, I hope will not be thought too impertinent a Digreſſion). <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(1.) That altho' Perſecution as yet for the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel had brought none to poverty for the Holy Goſpel's ſake, for if they were poor before they received the Holy Goſpel, then the Synagogue (of which they were) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them, but now they were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that proviſion, they having forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Synagogue, or at leaſt the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue them, becauſe of their forſaking their Judaiſm; for the Evangelick Church, that was now beginning to provide for

<note place="margin">An <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> that the gentile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts of <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Family, had this Gift of the Holy Ghoſt antecedent unto Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo that that was not neceſſary unto the Gift:

It's true, ſaith the Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt, tho' we own by the Promiſe the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, yet we do not believe that Gift excludes from Baptiſm, but we deny Baptiſm unto thoſe that are not qualified, as thoſe firſt Converts were, <hi>i. e.</hi> endued with the Gifts and Graces of Repentance and Faith. <label type="milestone">

               </label> This I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge true in thoſe Subjects that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of acting thoſe Graces, but not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in thoſe that have a natural, as well as moral incapacity to act thoſe Graces, as the Caſe with Children is, becauſe they are in Covenant, as hath been already declared and proved. And being Baptiſm is not the Covenant, but the Seal of the Covenant, he that is in Covenant hath a right to the Seal that enſures the Benefits and Priviledges of the Covenant, by the ſame Rule and Reaſon as he that is the true
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101430:88"/>Heir unto an Eſtate, hath a Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unto the Inſtruments that convey that Eſtate. Moreover add to this, Children have one of theſe Graces, tho' not the other; and if one be ſufficient, the other is not neceſſary; I mean Faith, which in ſome, and a true Senſe, they may be ſaid to have (otherwiſe the Bleſſed Jeſus would not have cautioned Perſons againſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little Ones that believe in him,

So of Hatred the odiouſneſs and deformity of that I am wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, I cannot properly be ſaid to hate: Now before Hatred, there uſually preceeds Grief and Sorrow; and I cannot be ſaid truly to lament or mourn for a Thing, if I underſtand not any loſs or damage I thereby ſuſtain. Now to apply this to our preſent Caſe, there may be a Sin pardoned in ſome Caſes, and in ſome
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101430:88"/>Perſons without Repentance, as that word imports Grief and Sorrow, Deteſtation and Hatred, Dereliction and Forſaking; by all this I mean Original Sin of which Infants are guilty as well as the Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the imputation and tranſmiſſion of the Protoplaſt's or firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Guilt. Now Children by reaſon of their Infantile capacity are not allowed the ability of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing theſe Paſſions, and cannot be ſaid to be afflicted and grieved, to deteſt and hate, to abandon and forſake that which was not their own proper and voluntary Act. So that upon this Account, Repentance is not neceſſary for their ſtate and condition, becauſe of their Incapacity to act the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of Repentance; and becauſe they lye not under ſuch a Perſonal Guilt, as may be ſaid in a more eſpecial manner to be proper and peculiar to the exerciſe of ſome parts of Repentance. But for Faith, ſo far as it is neceſſary, that Children in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to have it, as they have the Benefits of their Parents Faith derived to them. But that Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are not always, and in all Caſes indiſpenſably neceſſary unto Baptiſm, may appear plainly from the Inſtance of the Holy Jeſus [who was <hi>Nullius Poenitentiae Debitor</hi>] in him was no Guilt, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no neceſſity of Repenting; there was was no neceſſity of Faith in him; <hi>For of Faith he was the Author and Finiſher;</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:101430:89"/>as the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> acquaints us,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2.</note> and yet he ſubmitted to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, which was in order to Repentance, and therefore called the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance; and hereupon it is that Faith and Repentance are not always abſolutely and indiſpenſably needful to the being baptized.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101430:89"/>believe, that he who is the God of Reaſon, as well as Truth, will oblige his Creature to a Duty, which he is not able to perform by any Powers he hath created him with; and ſuppoſe God ſhould infuſe into a Child an extraordinary and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous meaſure of Grace as well as Reaſon, as he did into our bleſſed Saviour and St. <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who were ſanctified from, or in the Womb; yet we read not (tho' they had ſo great a proportion of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit) that during the ſtate of their infancy they magnified God, and ſpake with Tongues, (antecedent to the uſe of Speech) the manifeſtation of which Miraculous Power, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of which Divine Gift, the Jews at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt,

But to return, Tho' theſe Graces are not needful to all in all circumſtances, for where there is not a capacity to act them, there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to their exerciſe; yet that the Children of Believers have a right to the Covenant as ſoon as born, and ſo have a right to the Seal that conveys the Title, and are obliged to its Uſe, if they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Priviledges of the Covenant, I hope, hath been made appear beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, yet they are needful for ſome that are admitted unto that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and this Diſtinction ought to be well underſtood and weighed. If Baptiſm

In ſhort, It is as the condition is, or the needs of the Party require. In In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the matter is plain as to Repentance, the non-performance whereof cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their being baptized; becauſe they (having committed no ſin) are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the Duty; and yet this is as needful for being baptized as Faith: So that this evidences they are not abſolutely needful, not to all, not to Children, but only accidentally ſo; and if they may be baptized, if they want one, why not if they want the other, is a Myſtery that will not (nay, I am inclined to believe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not) be diſcovered by thoſe that (becauſe they think the contrary) are engaged to make the Revelation. Beſides, I add, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Faith is needful not to the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but to the ſubſequent Products of that Holy Ordinance; becauſe the firſt Planters of Chriſtianity admitted ſome
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101430:90"/>(tho' adult) to Baptiſm, who had no Faith, but were only formal Profeſſors, and of this ſort were <hi>Simon Magus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Copperſmith, <hi>Demas,</hi> and <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> (if baptized) and alſo the Gnoſtic Hereticks: For the Effect is from the Searcher of Hearts, who knows our ſecret thoughts, but the External Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance may be performed and undertaken by thoſe who know not ſuch Secrets. And this is a clear Proof, that that Faith which is needful to the product of the Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is not needful to its undertaking; and if formal Profeſſors may be partakers of it, much more Children; if to ſuch as actually impede or hinder the product, much rather to them that do not ſo.

<note place="margin">St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. St. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.42.</note> as we are told in Sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, in expreſs words, recorded by two Evangeliſts, if one be not enough, (And that this is a ſatisfactory and ſufficient

From whence I argue thus, That if the Faith of the Parent may be imputed for the recovering of the Bodily Diſeaſes, why may not the ſame be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the curing the Diſtempers of the Soul, I mean Sin? And is it not as reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſeeing the Guilt of another's Sin is imputed to us to make us miſerable, the Faith of another ſhould be conveyed and made over to us, to qualifie and fit us for a participation in ſuch an Ordinance as ſhould procure our Pardon, and deliver us from our Guilt, and thereby make us Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, which is done by being waſhed in the Laver of Baptiſm, which is called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>

And that there is reaſon for ſuch an Imputation, may appear from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101430:92"/>the relation Children have to their Father, which is that of Members with the Head, and of Parts with the Whole, the Father and Son, both in Holy Writ and Cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Uſage, (upon ſome Accounts) being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for one. Hereupon the Covenant made with the <hi>Proto-plaſt,</hi> or firſt Man, was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto his Poſterity, and the Deluge, or <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the periſhing of the Rebels in the gainſaying of <hi>Core,</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Jude</hi> 11.</note> included Infants, as well as the adult and full-grown. Now Reaſon as well as Religion in this matter, requireth help for Children; for if the Son be reckoned one with his Father, and ſo obnoxious to puniſhment, without any acting by the conſent of his own will, ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the tranſmiſſion of his Father's guilt, certainly then, when the Father is one of the Faithful, they ought ſo far to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with him, as upon that account to receive ſome advantage, and ſo to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Imputation of the Father's Faith, which may render them fit for a reception of the Benefits of the Covenant, and the Seal that enſures them. Hereupon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant given to <hi>Abraham</hi> is the ſame with that tranſacted with <hi>Adam;

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101430:95"/>this Chapter, and upon thoſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World, as appears eight Chapters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this,

<note place="margin">—iv. 34.</note> which were clear and great Teſtimonies, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit reſided and dwelt in their Souls. I know a great and learned Man ſaith he will not defend the Arguments
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101430:97"/>from this Text, becauſe he thinks it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent, for this reaſon, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the word Children, there uſed, is really the Poſterity of the Jews, and not their Infant-Children. And I believe ſo too: And yet, with deference to my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, and with ſubmiſſion unto better Judgments, I take the Argument to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding upon this account, becauſe it would be a great Incentive to incourage the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating Chriſtianity, and a Motive to both Jews and Gentiles, to embrace and come in and own themſelves Profeſſors of the Holy Goſpel, and Diſciples of the Bleſſed Jeſus. And it is very probable, in his firſt Sermon, St. <hi>Peter</hi> would uſe the moſt prevailing Argument with the Jews, that he might remove the Prejudice that lay upon their Hearts, to hinder them from believing in a crucified Saviour; and it is not improbable his numerous Auditors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him in this ſenſe, becauſe we read in the latter part of this Chapter, <hi>the ſame day were added to the Church about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souls:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> ij. 41.</note> So that when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Promiſe is to you, and unto your Children,</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid theſe words, O you Jews, that now hear me, if you will repent, and be baptized, you, and your Poſterity, and the Children of you, and your Poſterity, if you will repent, <hi>i. e.</hi> own your Guilt, in crucifying the Lord of Life and Glory, and embrace his Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101430:97"/>and live according to the Rules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and be baptized, <hi>i. e.</hi> receive the Sign of Admiſſion into the New Covenant of Grace, you and your Children ſhall have the ſame Priviledge you had in your own Diſpenſation under the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> your Children ſhall be in Covenant, as well as your ſelves, and equally with you be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sign of the Covenant, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as your Children are now admitted to Circumciſion, the Sign of the antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Covenant in your way; and this might be a great Argument to the Gentiles to become Chriſtians, becauſe they ſhould not only enjoy the ſame Priviledge as the Jew, if one of their Proſelytes, but much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by being a Diſciple of the Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; as much greater as the Holy Goſpel did exceed the Law, as appears by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument. But if the Miniſtration of Death, or the Law written and engraven in Stones was glorious, ſo that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly behold the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Glory of his Countenace, which Glory was to be done away, how ſhall not the Miniſtration of the Spirit or Goſpel be rather glorious? For if the Miniſtration of Condemnation, or the Law, be Glory, much more doth the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs or the Goſpel exceed in Glory; for even that which was made glorious, or the Law, had no Glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101430:98"/>the Glory or Goſpel that excelleth; for if that which was done away, or the Law was glorious, much more that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iij. 7.—12.</note> or the Goſpel is glorious. Thus, I hope, I may ſay, without aſſuming or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too much to my ſelf, I have reſcued this Text from the Antipedobaptiſts Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and drawn a concluding Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from it for Infant-Baptiſm; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks he hath founded the Practice upon a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Baſis,</hi> give me leave to mention it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will corroborate and confirm what I have ſaid, and when I ſhall have anſwered the Objections brought againſt the other place of Holy Scripture, I hope I ſhall for ever ſilence the Objections of any Antipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt from Holy Writ, from having any influence or prevalency on unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced minds, that love Truth better than Intereſt, and had rather comply with the Sacred inſtitutions of the Holy Jeſus, than carry on and promote any Faction againſt him and his Holy Religion. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this, Baptiſm, or Waſhing, was a known Rite, ſolemnly uſed among the Jews (as it is now among Chriſtians) for the initiating or entring Jews and Proſelytes into the Covenant of the Lord, and ſo into the Congregation of the Jews, as among us it is into the New Covenant, and into the Church of Chriſt. Many Branches of that Cuſtom there were, I ſhall briefly gather
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101430:98"/>them together, and farther teſtifie the truth of thoſe Affirmations, which any way ſeem queſtionable to any. (1.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Baptiſm, or Waſhing the whole Body, was a Jewiſh Solemnity, by which the Native Jews were entred into the Covenant of God made with them by <hi>Moſes.</hi> This that learned Doctor makes appear by ſeveral Quotations from their great Rabbins, and tells us, nothing can be more clearly affirmed by them. (2.) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As the Native Jews were thus entred into Covenant by Baptiſm, ſo the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes of the Jews that were taken in as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felytes of Juſtice or Righteouſneſs, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing or undertaking all their Law, (and not only as Proſelytes of the Gate to live among them) were received into their Church by Baptiſm likewiſe. This alſo the ſame excellent Doctor proves by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authorities and Teſtimonies of their learned Men in all Ages, whenſoever any Gentile was willing to enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to be gathered under the Wings of the [<hi>Schecinah,</hi> or] Divine Majeſty, and to undertake the Yoke of the Law, he was bound to have Baptiſm, Circumciſion, and a Peace-Offering; and if it were a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Baptiſm and Sacrifice. And again, the ſtranger that is circumciſed, and not baptized; or baptized, and not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arrianus in Epictet.</hi> l. 2. c. 9.</note> is not a true Proſelyte until he be both. A clear Teſtimony we have of this in <hi>Arrianus,</hi> the Stoic Philoſopher, where
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101430:99"/>the Jewiſh Proſelyte is by him called [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] Dipped; and he that is ſo only in ſhew, not indeed, is termed [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] a counterfeit baptized Perſon. So that it is obſervable, that the Baptiſm of the Native Jews, was the Pattern by which the Baptiſm of the Proſelytes was regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and wherein it was founded. By all this it appears how little needful it will be to defend the Baptiſm of Chriſtians from the Law of circumciſing Infants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, the Foundation being far more fitly laid in that other of Jewiſh Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, a Ceremony of Initiation or Entrance for all, (eſpecially for Proſelytes, who were by Water to be cleanſed from the Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Defilements of Heatheriſm, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were to be admitted into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by the Token, thereof, Circumciſion) as well as that of Circumciſion; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that of Circumciſion belonged only to one, the other was common to both Sexes; and yet from that Example of Circumciſion, among them, thus much muſt needs be gain'd to our preſent Deſign, that the Child's not being able to underſtand the Vow of Baptiſm, doth no way prejudice the baptizing of ſuch, for if it did, it muſt neceſſarily be an Objection againſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the Jewiſh Child at eight days old, who could then no more underſtand the Covenant, of which that was made the Sign, nor the Wickedneſs that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101430:99"/>into the Covenant obliged to abſtain from, than the Chriſtian-Infant now can, and yet (under pain of Exciſion, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off) was commanded to be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which being ſo far vindicated from being unreaſonable and incongruous,

And here I ſhall found Chriſtian-Baptiſm, rather than in Circumciſion; but if any ſhall overthrow the Argument commonly taken from Circumciſion, my Return is, That it may be made uſe of by the Rule of Proportion, and tho' it may not directly prove, yet it clearly illuſtrates the truth; for,

Yet it may be reaſonably inferred from the Judgment of Heaven, (in a Caſe exactly like) that ſuch may be admitted in a Sacramental way, to be partakers of a Covenant, who do not, at their admiſſion into it, clearly apprehend the terms of it, as is evident in the circumciſing of the Infant. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Account of Circumciſion, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101430:100"/>Antipedobaptiſts Argument or Objection infers,

To which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I do not ſay, Circumciſion is a Type of Baptiſm, nor do I infer any thing from it; Baptiſm was ſubſtituted inſtead of Circumciſion, not as the Antitype comes in the room of the Type, but as one eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Appointment comes in after a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that is diſuſed and laid aſide; and this is needful Men ſhould be acquainted with, becauſe the Antipedobaptiſts would weaken the ſtrength of ſome Reaſons, which, without the allowance of this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, or Suppoſition, are not eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by objecting and affirming,

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101430:100"/>higher and more exalted Senſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Antitype, than to it ſelf. Accordingly the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Offerings that had a tendency to cleanſe the outward Man, were but weak Repreſentings of the more powerful force, and greater value of the Blood of the Holy Jeſus, the Sacrifice of whoſe Blood was of ſuch great Efficacy, (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us) that it was able to purge the Conſcience from dead Works to ſerve the living God.

But baptizing was an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or appointment under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and therefore Circumciſion could not be a Type and Repreſentation of it; becauſe it was for ſome Ages admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred at the ſame time therewith: I allow Circumciſion to be a Divine Inſtitution, a Rite of entring Jews and their Infants into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant: And I allow Baptiſm in this to be the like, by a correſpondency therewith of entring us into the Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant; that it is a Rite of Entrance for the Proſelytes of Chriſtians and their Infants into the Covenant of Grace, not after the way of Circumciſion, but the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Baptiſms. For the making out of which Principle, if I had only the proof of the Circumciſion of the Infants of the Jews, and the concurrent uſage of the firſt Planters of Chriſtianity and their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in the early times of the Church that followed their Example, I ſhould not infer it from the Jews circumciſing Children; becauſe tho' by the inſtance of circumciſing Children under the old Law, it hath been

They ſeem to offer an Argument why circumciſing ſhould be more proper for Infants than baptizing them; becauſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion left a Character in the Fleſh, which being impreſſed on Children did its work, when they were Adult, and baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left no remanent Character.

And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101430:102"/>whereas it differs in regard of the Infant, ſure it is that at the ſeaſon of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſignifies not at all; becauſe then the Child hath not the power or faculty of underſtanding the Character; and that he knows when he becomes Adult, ariſes from Teaching and Diſcipline: For the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter imprinted, when he is circumciſed hath no ſignification by Nature, but only by the will of him that appoints it, or becauſe it is inſtituted; elſe <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was in Confederation and Covenant with God, as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and conſequently the Infant can never know it by the force of natural Principles, but as he is taught when he is at Age, how he was uſed in his Infancy, and the reaſon of it; and therefore the Law that enjoyned Circumciſion, enjoyned Inſtruction; and of that the Chriſtian that hath Baptiſm, when a Child, is as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable as a Jewiſh Child that hath Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in its Infancy; and the diligence of the Church may be as exact in our days, as the care was great in the Synagogue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101430:104"/>to be preferred before the Matrimonial one, and the Holy Scripture is to be taken in the more favourable and exalted ſenſe, rather than in an inferior or ſubordinate one; and beſides this is agreeable to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Cuſtom, where when any married to an Heathen, the Male-Children after ſuch a Marriage were circumciſed, (whether the Children were born before or after ſuch a Marriage) which cauſed the Holy Apoſtle, in alluſion thereto, to uſe that Phraſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing whole Houſholds (which makes the Argument concluding, whether there were any Children in thoſe Families mentioned or no) by virtue of one of the Parents Faith. And without the allowance of this ſenſe, it is impoſſible to (come to the right interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this and many other places of Holy Scripture in the New Teſtament. Add to all this, that tho' this Hypotheſis, or ſeemingly fair Principle of the Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Legitimacy, may ſeem plauſible to the inconſiderate Many, yet it cannot be a true Interpretation, as will appear unto any judicious conſidering perſon, for this reaſon, becauſe it offereth no greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Gentile to become Chriſtian, than what he enjoyed in his Heathen ſtate. For I doubt not but it may be proved from ſeveral Teſtimonies taken from the Authorities of good Claſſic Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors among the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, that where a Man or Woman were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101430:104"/>married, according unto the Rites and Cuſtoms of their ſeveral Countries, their Children were legitimate, and if that ſhould be the ſenſe, they might be Holy in their Heathen ſtate, which may ſeem to be <hi>[contradictio in adjecto]</hi> (to uſe the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians Phraſe) the higheſt abſurdity being a contradiction in terms; whereas our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation offereth a conſiderable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo far that it cannot be interpreted of a Matrimonial Legitimacy, as is evident by <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy husband; or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy wife?</hi> Which ſhews, that the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coherence cannot contradict the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Connexion; and the Holy Apoſtle, doubtleſs, would not have ſaid this, if his meaning in the 14th Verſe, had carried on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſenſe of a Matrimonial Legitimacy, to free the married Couple from the great and crying guilt of Adultery

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101430:108"/>is a clear proof of the point in hand. Were not this the Import of it, there were no Priviledge imaginable, no Sanctity could be attributed unto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which would not belong to the Infants of Heathens alſo, which yet is here directly affirmed of the one, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to the other by the Holy Apoſtle; and as this evidently concludeth ſuch a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom known and acknowledged among Chriſtians at that time, ſo it is directly the thing that the Jewiſh practice (in which Chriſt founded his Inſtitution) hath laid the foundation of in baptizing Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes and their Children, and to which the primitive Church conformed: And ſo though that <hi>Judaic</hi> practice taken alone were not deemed any demonſtrative evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Chriſt thus inſtituted his Baptiſm for the Gentile World; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in conjunction with this Holy Apoſtolic practice, and the primitive uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, it brings all the weight with it that a divine Teſtimony, interpreted by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, can afford, which is as great as any ſuch matter can be capable of. And thus I have ſufficiently, I hope, anſwered the Objection that would overthrow the true Senſe I had before given of this place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and offered Reaſons ſo ſtrong and ſo plain, as may ſatisfie any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced reaſonable Man. For Reaſons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101430:109"/>muſt be plainer than the Matters they are brought to give a Proof of; becauſe when we go about to prove a Matter that is queſtionable, we muſt do it by ſuch (Mediums and) Methods that are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well as cogent. And now from this Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, That Children have a right unto the Covenant, under the new Diſpenſation, as our Adverſaries own and acknowledge they had under the old one; and then let the moſt learned of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries make appear at what time, or when they were excluded and ſhut out, and we will acknowledge and own our ſelves in a Miſtake: And if they cannot do that, they ought to confeſs and declare, we have Truth on our ſide, and that they are in an error; which though Men (out of love to their Reputation or a miſtaken Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) they are unwilling to come to, yet I am certain it is their Duty to do it.</p>
